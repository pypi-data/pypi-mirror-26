Change log
----------


Version 0.18.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Released: 2017-10-19

This is the base version for this change log. The zhmccli project was
split off of the python-zhmcclient project based upon its released
version 0.17.0. For prior changes, see the change log of the
python-zhmcclient project.

Additional changes:

* Fixed the issue that the readline module is not available in
  standard python on Windows, by using the pyreadline module
  in that case.

* Fixed a flawed setup of setuptools in Python 2.7 on the Travis CI, where
  the metadata directory of setuptools existed twice, by adding a script
  `remove_duplicate_setuptools.py` that removes the moot copy of the metadata
  directory (python-zhmcclient issue #434).

* Added the version of the zhmcclient package to the output of
  ``zhmc --version``.

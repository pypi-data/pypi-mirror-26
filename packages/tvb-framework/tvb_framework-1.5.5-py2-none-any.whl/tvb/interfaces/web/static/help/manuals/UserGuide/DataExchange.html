<span id="data-formats"></span><h1><em>TheVirtualBrain</em> Data Formats<a class="headerlink" href="#tvb-data-formats" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>The purpose of this chapter is to provide some details about the way <em>TheVirtualBrain</em>
instance/installation can exchange data with other <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> instances, or with
other applications available in the neuroscience community. Currently, there are
several applications that can analyze and record brain activity in different
formats, and one of the goals of <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> is to allow users from different
backgrounds to have quick access to their recorded data.</p>
<p>To achieve this, we have implemented some mechanisms to <strong>IMPORT / EXPORT</strong> data
at different levels and formats:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Project</strong> - As you may know, <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> data is organized in projects and
one of the options is to transfer projects (with attached data) entirely
between <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> installations. This mechanism can be used only between <em>TheVirtualBrain</em>
applications, and no other external tools.</li>
<li><strong>Simple Data</strong> - This feature allows you to transfer independent data (e.g.
surface, connectivity, time series) between two <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> instances or between <em>TheVirtualBrain</em>
and an external application. As you may note later, depending on the targeted
application, data can be exchanged in a custom <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> format or a commonly used
format used in the neuroscience community (e.g. CFF, GIFTI, NIFTI ...)</li>
</ul>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>During export and import operations <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> does not apply any space
transformation, so users have to ensure their data (especially in case
of import) is generated/stored in the same space.</p>
<p class="last"><em>TheVirtualBrain</em>&#8216;s default project contains data in a space where the nose is pointing
in the direction of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">-y</span></tt> and the left ear in the direction of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+x</span></tt>.
The space is right handed: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">+z</span></tt> points up.</p>
</div>
<p>Before proceeding with more details about data exchange, it would be helpful to
give you an idea how <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> stores its data. Basically there are two major
storage areas:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><em>Database</em> - where general information/metadata are stored and relation
between stored elements (e.g. assignment of data to a project, data metadata
- creation date, owner, etc...)</li>
<li><em>Disk</em> - here we store &#8220;the real&#8221; data in a HDF5 format
(<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5</a>). This means that for each data type (e.g.
surface, connectivity, time series) we store on the disk, it is given a
folder structure in an HDF5 / H5 file which contains all data (e.g. vertices,
triangles, etc ...). This format has the following advantages which made it an
optimal solution for our product:<ul>
<li>can store huge pieces of data and can access it very fast (even random
access)</li>
<li>can organize data in a tree structure (groups and leaves)</li>
<li>allows assignment of metadata on every level</li>
<li>is a format agreed upon by the community and can be used/opened with
different tools/languages (Python, Matlab, java, C++ ...)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<div class="line-block">
<div class="line"><br /></div>
</div>
<p>An important aspect of <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> storage is that each data/datatype has associated a
GUID, which makes it unique on every system where that data exists.</p>
<div class="section" id="exchange-projects">
<h2>Exchange Projects<a class="headerlink" href="#exchange-projects" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p><em>TheVirtualBrain</em> product can be installed both on a server, to be used concurrent by multiple
users, but also as a standalone application on a desktop/laptop for personal use.
Specifically for the second scenario, there was an important request to allow
people to exchange data. So, <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> has a mechanism to export and import an entire
project to another system.</p>
<div class="section" id="export-project">
<h3>Export Project<a class="headerlink" href="#export-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Using <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> interface, any user can export their projects in a custom format that
can be transferred to other users.</p>
<div class="section" id="file-format">
<h4>File Format<a class="headerlink" href="#file-format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Export results are a ZIP file (named: date + project name), containing in a

contains:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">A root level XML file with details about the project itself</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Folders for each operation performed as part of the project</p>

<h3>Import Project<a class="headerlink" href="#import-project" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A project exported on one system can now be imported on another machine. In the

<div class="section" id="id1">

<h2>Export Data<a class="headerlink" href="#export-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Using <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> interface, users can view all data types associated with a project and
choose to export individual pieces of data.</p>
<p>The <em>Export Datatype</em> operation results in a file with a format specific to <em>TheVirtualBrain</em>; it is not
a standard format that can be used automatically by other software. This is
basically HDF5/H5 format
[<a class="reference external" href="http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5">http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5</a>] which, for each
data type, contains both data and metadata. These files can be easily opened in
Python / Matlab / Java / C++ for additional processing.</p>
<p>In case you want to process HDF5 files with Matlab you can find API
documentation here:</p>

<div class="section" id="id2">
<h3>File Format<a class="headerlink" href="#id2" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As a result of a Simulation or Analyze function, <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> can generate either a data
type or a group of data types. Each of such structures can be exported as follows:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>if a simple data type is exported, the result is an HDF5 file which has a root
node datatype metadata and leaves the real data.</li>
<li>if a data type group is exported, the result is a ZIP file containing:<ul>
<li>at root level, an XML file with the details of the operation that
generated the data types</li>
<li>a list of HDF5 files, one for each data type included in the exported
group. Each file has structure/details as described above in the case of
simple data type export. <em>This format applies to any |TVB| data type.</em></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="import-data">
<h2>Import Data<a class="headerlink" href="#import-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Probably this is the most important feature of data exchange, since it allows
<em>TheVirtualBrain</em> to bring together data generated independently by other systems/applications
and allows it&#8217;s users to perform different analyses on it and visualize them.
Since there is an abundance of formats available for neuroimaging data, <em>TheVirtualBrain</em>
tries to support as many as possible for an improved user experience.</p>
<div class="admonition warning">
<p class="first admonition-title">Warning</p>
<p>In case the imported data includes/represents a surface, <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> does an extra
check regarding the number of vertices of that surface. Basically you can
not import into <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> a surface that has more vertices than a MAX value.</p>
<p class="last">This MAX value is defines and can be changed in the Application Settings
area, depending on the configuration/performance of your hardware.</p>

<p>In correlation with export operations, <em>TheVirtualBrain</em> interface allows import of data in
<em>TheVirtualBrain</em> format that has been exported from other systems. This format applies to any
<em>TheVirtualBrain</em> data type. Depending on the uploaded file format, imported data can be as
follows:</p>
<div class="section" id="id3">

<li>If user uploads a simple HDF5/H5 file, the system assumes that a simple data
type is imported and tries to process the file accordingly. Basically it
reads the metadata stored in the root node group and determines the data type
(e.g. connectivity, time series ...). Based on the detected type of data, the
rest of the details are filled and the object is stored in the database.</li>

<p>The file is expected to hold a vector of length number of vertices in the Cortical Surface.
The numeric values should be in the interval (0...n-1), where n is the number of regions in  the connectivity.</p>

<h3>Import Projection Matrix<a class="headerlink" href="#import-projection-matrix" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A Projection Matrix, is intended to define a mapping from a source object and a set of sensors.
The source entity can be either a Cortical Surface or a Connectivity, in <em>TheVirtualBrain</em>.
In order for this import to work, you will need to have previously imported in <em>TheVirtualBrain</em>:
both the source and the sensors entities.</p>

<h4>File Format<a class="headerlink" href="#id12" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>For this upload we expect a single text file, with numeric values, space and line separated.
The numeric values in the uploaded file should hold a matrix of size (n, m).
<strong>n</strong> is the number of sensors, and <strong>m</strong> is the  number of nodes. When the
projection matrix we want to import is a
Surface Projection Matrix, <strong>m</strong> will be the number of vertices in the target Cortical Surface.
When the projection matrix is a region-level one, <strong>m</strong> will be the number of regions in the Connectivity.
Having headers in the text file is not accepted. An incorrect number of values (lines or rows) in the
Projection Matrix will also raise an exception.</p>

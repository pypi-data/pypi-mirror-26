Description: Lunatic Python is a two-way bridge between Python and Lua, allowing these
        languages to intercommunicate. Being two-way means that it allows Lua inside
        Python, Python inside Lua, Lua inside Python inside Lua, Python inside Lua
        inside Python, and so on. This package is a fork of the original from
        http://labix.org/lunatic-python, updated to support Python 3, and forked
        again from https://github.com/bastibe/lunatic-python to release to PyPi.

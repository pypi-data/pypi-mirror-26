papertrade
==========

What is called "Paper trading" is basically practicing trading with
'fake' money. Thus preparing oneself for actual trading, without the
risk.

This tool is designed to help with this, and uses Yahoo finance as a
data source for prices. Tickers not listed there, will not show.

*papertrade* gives you a fake account to do fake trading in, and gives
you an overview of how good you are doing.

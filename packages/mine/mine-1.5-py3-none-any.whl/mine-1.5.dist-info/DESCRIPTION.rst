Overview
========

This program lets you synchronize application data using Dropbox.

It automatically starts and stops programs that would otherwise fight
over data in a shared folder and ensures only one instance is running.
Many applications work fine when their data is stored in Dropbox, but
some programs overwrite databases:

-  iTunes
-  iPhoto
-  etc.

while others periodically write snapshot data:

-  Eclipse
-  Xcode
-  etc.

and some just don't make sense to keep running on all your computers:

-  Slack
-  HipChat
-  etc.

Setup
=====

Requirements
------------

-  Python 3.6+

Installation
------------

Install mine with pip:

.. code:: sh

    $ pip install mine

or directly from the source code:

.. code:: sh

    $ git clone https://github.com/jacebrowning/mine.git
    $ cd mine
    $ python setup.py install

Configuration
-------------

Create a ``mine.yml`` in your Dropbox:

.. code:: yaml

    config:
      computers:
      - name: My iMac
        hostname: My-iMac.local
        address: 00:11:22:33:44:55
      - name: My MacBook Air
        hostname: My-MacBook-Air.local
        address: AA:BB:CC:DD:EE:FF
      applications:
      - name: iTunes
        properties:
          auto_queue: false
          single_instance: true
        versions:
          mac: iTunes.app
          windows: iTunes.exe
          linux: null
      - name: Slack
        properties:
          auto_queue: true
          single_instance: false
        versions:
          mac: Slack.app
          windows: null
          linux: null

Include the applications you would like ``mine`` to manage. Computers
are added automatically when ``mine`` is run.

The ``versions`` dictionary identifies the name of the executable on
each platform. The ``properties.auto_queue`` setting indicates ``mine``
should attempt to launch the application automatically when switching
computers. The ``properties.single_instance`` setting indicates the
application must be closed on other computers before another instance
can start.

Usage
=====

To synchronize the current computer's state:

.. code:: sh

    $ mine

To close applications on remote computers and start them locally:

.. code:: sh

    $ mine switch

To close applications running locally:

.. code:: sh

    $ mine close

To close applications locally and start them on another computer:

.. code:: sh

    $ mine switch <name>

To delete conflicted files in your Dropbox:

.. code:: sh

    $ mine clean

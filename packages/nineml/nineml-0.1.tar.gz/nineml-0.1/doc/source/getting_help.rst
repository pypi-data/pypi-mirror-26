If you find a bug or would like to add a new feature to the Python :mod:`nineml` package, please go to
https://github.com/INCF/nineml/issues/. First check that there is not an
existing ticket for your bug or request, then click on "New issue" to create a
new ticket (you will need a GitHub account, but creating one is simple and painless). Please add the label "Python"
to the ticket.

If you would like to propose a change to the specification, use the same issue tracker but use the label "spec".

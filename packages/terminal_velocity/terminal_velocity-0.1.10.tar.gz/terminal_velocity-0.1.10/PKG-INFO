Description: Terminal Velocity
        =================
        
        
        `Terminal Velocity` is a fast note-taking app for the UNIX terminal, that
        focuses on letting you create or find a note as quickly and easily as possible,
        then uses your ``$EDITOR`` to open and edit the note. It is heavily inspired
        by the OS X app `Notational Velocity <http://notational.net/>`_.
        For screenshots and features, see the
        `Terminal Velocity website <http://vhp.github.com/terminal_velocity>`_.
        
        To install Terminal Velocity, run::
        
            pip install terminal_velocity
        
        Then to launch it just run::
        
            terminal_velocity
        
        To use a different notes directory, run::
        
            terminal_velocity path/to/your/notes/dir
        
        To see all the command-line options, run::
        
            terminal_velocity -h
        
        To quit the app, press ``ctrl-c`` or ``ctrl-x``.
        
        To upgrade Terminal Velocity to the latest version, run::
        
            pip install --upgrade terminal_velocity
        
        To uninstall it, run::
        
            pip uninstall terminal_velocity

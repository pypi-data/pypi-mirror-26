devpi-client-extensions
=======================

Some useful stuff around `devpi client`_. Although this package is proudly named *extensions*,
currently there is only one thing implemented ready to be used: a hook that uses passwords from
``.pypirc`` on login to devpi server so you don't have to enter your password if you store it for upload anyway.

Install
-------

.. code-block:: sh

   $ pip install devpi-client-extensions

Usage
-----

Just use the ``devpi login`` command as usual:

.. code-block:: sh

   $ devpi login hoefling
   Using hoefling credentials from .pypirc
   logged in 'hoefling', credentials valid for 10.00 hours

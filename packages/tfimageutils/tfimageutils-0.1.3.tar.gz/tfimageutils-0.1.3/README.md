# TFImageUtils

This package contains utilities for working with images in Tensorflow.

Currently, it only contains the ImageFeeder, which encapsulates loading images into a Tensorflow representation for further processing via a feed_dict.


## Roadmap

* Finding files by going through subfolders
* Non-flattened images for use with CNN's
* Other ways of using images in Tensorflow (Datasources)

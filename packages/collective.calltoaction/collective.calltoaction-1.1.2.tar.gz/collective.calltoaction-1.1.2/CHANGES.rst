1.1.1 (2017-02-08)
------------------

- Fixed problem when showing viewlet with form globally.
  After submit, the form could then be shown twice.
  We had already fixed that for the normal case,
  but not for the case where the viewlet is globally shown.

1.1 (2017-02-07)
----------------

- Added form field to portlet.  You can select a PloneFormGen FormFolder with this.
  The portlet then shows this as an embedded form under the title and text.

- Added control panel option to always show the popup.
  This ignores the cookie. This can be handy during development.
  You need to run the upgrade in the add-ons control panel.

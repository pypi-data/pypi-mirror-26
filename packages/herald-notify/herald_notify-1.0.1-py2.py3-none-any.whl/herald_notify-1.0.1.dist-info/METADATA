Herald
======

Programmatically send notifications!

About
-----

Have you ever been in a situation where you've been simply twiddling
your thumbs, waiting for your program to finish compiling/running? Are
you into Deep Learning and need a way to notify yourself when your
program crashes or is done learning to do the impossible?

Then *Herald* is for you!

With a simple, extensible and pythonic interface, you can get setup with
a programmatic way of notifying yourself and/or your teammates about
different events in your code.

The following platforms are currently supported:

-  GMail
-  Twilio

Need to use it with a custom platform? You can easily write your own
``notifier`` and plug it in to handle that, making *Herald* infinitely
extensible.

Installation
------------

The easy ``pip install herald-notify``.

Usage
-----

The primary way to use *Herald* is like a context manager. E.g.

.. code:: python

    import herald
    from herald import notifiers

    # Send yourself a mail in Gmail to notify you
    # Assumes your Gmail tokens have been set up properly
    notifier = notifiers.GmailNotifier()

    with Herald(notifier, message="Model Trained!"):
        # super long running process
        train_model()
        ...

You should get an email in your registered Gmail account at the end of
the program.

You can also specify notifications at arbitrary points via the
``notifier`` call:

.. code:: python

    import herald
    from herald import notifiers

    notifier = notifiers.TerminalNotifier("Whoop de doo!")

    notifier.notify("A new custom message")

    # Send the original message from the constructor
    notifier.notify()

Pull Request!

Development
~~~~~~~~~~~

To set up your dev environment, perform the following steps: - Clone
*Herald* - Inside the root directory, run ``pipenv shell`` to open a
shell. - Finally run ``pipenv install`` to install all the dependencies.

At this point, you should be good to go!

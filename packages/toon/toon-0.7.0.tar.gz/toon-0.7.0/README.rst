Description
-----------

Additional tools for neuroscience experiments, including:

* A framework for polling input devices on a separate process.
* Helper functions for generating auditory stimuli (read: beeps).
* Coordinate tools (slightly modified from :code:`psychopy.tools.coordinatetools`), which additionally allow for calculations relative to points other than the origin.

Everything *should* work on Windows/Mac/Linux.

See requirements.txt for dependencies.

Many of the full examples require :code:`psychopy` to operate.

Install
-------

Current release::

    pip install toon

Development version::

    pip install git+https://github.com/aforren1/toon

For full install (including dependencies of included devices)::

    pip install toon[full]

See setup.py for a list of those dependencies, as well as device-specific subdivisions.

Usage Overview
--------------

Audio
~~~~~

This sample generates a four-beep metronome for the timed response experiment.::

     import numpy as np
     import toon.audio as ta
     from psychopy import sound

     beeps = ta.beep_sequence([440, 880, 1220], inter_click_interval=0.4)
     beep_aud = sound.Sound(np.transpose(np.vstack((beeps, beeps))),
                            blockSize=32,
                            hamming=False)
     beep_aud.play()

Input
~~~~~

Generally useful input devices include:

- Keyboard (for changes in keyboard state) via `Keyboard`

The following are in-house devices, which may not be generally useful but could serve as examples
of how to implement additional devices:

- HAND (custom force measurement device) by class `Hand`
- Flock of Birds (position tracker) by class `BlamBirds`
- Force Transducers (predecessor to HAND) by class `ForceTransducers` (Windows only.)

Generally, input devices can be used as follows::

     from psychopy import core
     from toon.input import <device>, MultiprocessInput

     timer = core.monotonicClock.getTime

     dev = MultiprocessInput(<device>(clock_source=timer, <device-specific args>))

     with dev as d:
         while not done:
             timestamp, data = d.read()
             ...

You can perform a sanity check for existing devices via::

     python -m toon.examples.try_inputs --dev <device> --mp True

Tools
~~~~

Current tools:

- cart2pol
- pol2cart
- cart2sph
- sph2cart

For example,::

    import toon.tools as tt

    x, y = tt.pol2cart(45, 3, units='deg', ref=(1, 1))

Extended Examples
-----------------

If you have psychopy and the HAND, you can run an example via::

    python -m toon.examples.psychhand

If you're hooked up to the kinereach (also works with a mouse), try::

    python -m toon.examples.kinereach

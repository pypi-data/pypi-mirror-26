SYNOPSIS
========

  diffoscope [-h] [--json output] [OPTIONS] file1 file2

  diffoscope [-h] [OPTIONS] diff_file

  diffoscope [-h] [OPTIONS] < diff_file

DESCRIPTION
===========

diffoscope will try to get to the bottom of what makes files or
directories different. It will recursively unpack archives of many kinds
and transform various binary formats into more human readable form to
compare them. It can compare two tarballs, ISO images, or PDF just as
easily.

It can be scripted through error codes, and a report can be produced
with the detected differences. The report can be text or HTML.
When no type of report has been selected, diffoscope defaults
to write a text report on the standard output.

diffoscope is developed as part of the “reproducible builds” Debian
project and was formerly known as “debbindiff”.

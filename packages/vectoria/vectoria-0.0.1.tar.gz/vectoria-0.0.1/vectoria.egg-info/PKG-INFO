Description: # Vectoria
        A Word Vector Encoder, used to turn word strings into dense numerical embeddings for
        machine learning models.
        
        ## Words and Character Trigrams
        Both word and chararacter trigram parsings are supported, though readily available
        GLOVE word vectors do not provide for trigram parsing.
        
        ## Model Download
        The various embedding classes will download and compile dense numpy arrays
        of word vectors. Allow for 4G of space for each language model. The model
        files will be cached as additional files within the downloaded and installed python
        module.
        
        ## [FastText](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText)
        FastText is a unique word encoding model that combines full words and
        character ngrams, allowing encodings of unknown words to be estimated by their
        constituent characters.
        
        And, there are [pretrained vectors](https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md) 
        available for many languages, which means you can get started quickly. This library
        will download and unpack those pretrained models for you.
        
        
        Take a look at the ```examples``` folder.

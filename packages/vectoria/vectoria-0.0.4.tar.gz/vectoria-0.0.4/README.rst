Vectoria
========

A Word Vector Encoder, used to turn word strings into dense numerical
encodings for machine learning models.

`FastText <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText>`__
-----------------------------------------------------------

FastText is a unique word encoding model that combines full words and
character ngrams, allowing encodings of unknown words to be estimated by
their constituent characters.

And, there are `pretrained
vectors <https://github.com/facebookresearch/fastText/blob/master/pretrained-vectors.md>`__
available for many languages, which means you can get started quickly.
This library will download and unpack those pretrained models for you.

Take a look at the ``examples`` folder.

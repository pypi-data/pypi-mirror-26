# z-format

An opinionated CLI formatter for JavaScript and CSS (beautify or minimize). 

If the file is being beautified, the file's contents are replaced with the new 
formatting. If the file is being minimized, we create a new file with `.min` 
before the normal file extensions (e.g. `.min.js` or `.min.css`). 


## Usage

```sh
usage: format.py [-h] [-m] path

An opinionated CLI formatter for JavaScript and CSS (beautify or minimize). 

positional arguments:
  path          file's path to format

optional arguments:
  -h, --help    show this help message and exit
  -m, --minify  minimize the file's content instead of beautifying
```


## Install

```sh
pip install z-format
```


## Dependencies

This is a simple wrapper for several libraries which it installs by default:

 - jsbeautifier - JavaScript beautification
 - jsmin - JavaScript minification
 - cssformatter - CSS beautification and minification

Description: lightvolume
        ===========
        
        This package provides the module ``lightvolume``, which offers a CFFI binding
        to `trylock/visibility`_. This, in turn, is a C++ implementation of `the
        visibility algorithm`_ documented in detail (with awesome interactive demos)
        on the Red Blob Games website.

        First, import ``lightvolume``::
        
            import lightvolume
        
        Then, we can create a number of shadow-casting bodies::
        
            objects = [
                lightvolume.rect(0, 0, 500, 500),  # outer bounds - this is needed
                lightvolume.rect(20, 30, 10, 20),
                lightvolume.rect(290, 300, 100, 300),
            ]
        
        
        Finally, we can render the lit area cast by a light in this scene (an OpenGL
        context must already have been created and appropriate GL state set)::
        
            light = 90, 200
            lightvolume.draw_light(light, objects)
        
        
        This module is intended to be used with appropriate shaders to provide
        attenuation, surface interactions such as bump mapping, and so on.

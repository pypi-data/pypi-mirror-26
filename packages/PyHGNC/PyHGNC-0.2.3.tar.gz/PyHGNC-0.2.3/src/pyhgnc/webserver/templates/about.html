    <h1>About PyUniProt</h1>
    <p>
        :code:`PyUniProt` is python software interface developed by the
    `Department of Bioinformatics <https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en/business-research-areas/bioinformatics.html>`_
    at the Fraunhofer Institute for Algorithms and Scientific Computing
    `SCAI <https://www.scai.fraunhofer.de/en.html>`_
    to the data provided by the `European Bioinformatics Institute (EMBL-EBI) <http://www.ebi.ac.uk/>`_ on their
    `UniProt website <http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/>`_.

    The content of UniProt and the use of PyUniProt in combination with `PyBEL <https://pyuniprot.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ supports
    successfully scientists in the `IMI <https://www.imi.europa.eu/>`_ funded projects
    `AETIONOMY <http://www.aetionomy.eu/>`_  and `PHAGO <https://www.imi.europa.eu/content/phago>`_
    in the identification of potential drugs in complex disease networks with several thousands of
    relationships compiled from `BEL <http://openbel.org/>`_ statements.

    Aim of this software project is to provide an programmatic access to locally stored UniProt data and
    allow a filtered export in several formats used in the scientific community. Many query functions allow search in the
    data and use it as `pandas.DataFrame` in Jupyter notebooks.
    We will focus our software development on the analysis and extension of biological disease knowledge networks.
    PyUniProt is an ongoing project and needs improvement. We are happy if you want support our project or start
    a scientific cooperation with us.

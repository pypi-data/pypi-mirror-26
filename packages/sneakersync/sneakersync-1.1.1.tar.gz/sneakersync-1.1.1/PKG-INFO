Description: \# Sneakersync
        
        Synchronize files through the
        \[sneakernet\](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sneakernet>), i.e. using a
        removable drive.
        
        Requirements:
        
        -   \[rsync\](<https://rsync.samba.org/>). The version must support
            extended attributes (-X flag).
        -   A removable drive with a filesystem matching the source and target
            computers.
        -   Feet or a compatible mean of transportation of the removable drive
            between computers.
        
        \#\# Installation
        
        Simply run pip install sneakersync.
        
        \#\# Configuration
        
        The configuration is a
        \[YAML\](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YAML)-formatted> file that
        contains *modules* (directories to be synchronized) and *filters* (rules
        that exclude or include files or directories). Each module must contain
        a *root* entry (the top-level path to be synchronized) and may contain
        filters; if no filter is specified, all files and directories below the
        root of the module are included. Filters are defined by a list of
        *include* or *exclude* directives.
        
        A minimal example which synchronizes the home folder of a user would
        look like: `` `yaml modules:   - root: /home/john.doe ``\`
        
        To exclude a directory (and its content) and files with a given
        extension from a module, add a *filters* directive:
        `` `yaml modules:   - root: /home/john.doe     filters:       - exclude: /home/john.doe/.firefox/caches       - exclude: *.pyc ``\`
        
        To filter entries from all modules, use the top-level *filters*
        directive:
        `` `yaml modules:   - root: /home/john.doe   - root: /home/jane.blogs filters:   - exclude: .firefox/caches ``\`
        
        Filters defined at the top-level will have priority over module-level
        filters.
        
        \#\# Usage
        
        1.  Create a filesystem on a removable drive that matches the source and
            target computers.
        2.  Optional, but highly recommended:
            \[encrypt\](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disk_encryption>) your
            removable drive.
        3.  Store the \[configuration\](\#configuration) in a file named
            sneakersync.cfg on the root of the drive.
        4.  To send data, run sneakersync send &lt;PATH\_TO\_YOUR\_DRIVE&gt;.
        5.  Move your drive to the other computer and plug it in.
        6.  To receive data, run
            sneakersync receive &lt;PATH\_TO\_YOUR\_DRIVE&gt;.

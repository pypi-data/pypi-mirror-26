Installing mtfit
*********************************

mtfit can be installed simply by calling::
    
    >>python setup.py install

mtfit is dependent on numpy and scipy, and for MATLAB -v7.3 support also requires h5py.
Cluster support will be automatically installed via pyqsub from github
MPI support requires mpi4py built against a valid MPI distribution.




! Known Bug - running with MPI and very large non-zero MT results can lead to an error: mpi4py SystemError: Negative size passed to PyString_FromStringAndSize - to fix, re-run with smaller sample sizes

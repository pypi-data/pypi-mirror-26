        A Python 3.4+ package to check for sales at Countdown grocery stores throughout New Zealand.
        Pretty rough, but gets the job done.
        
        
        Installation
        =============
        ``pip install -U git+https://github.com/araichev/countdowner``
        
        
        Usage
        ======
        Here is a common workflow.
        
        #. Get the stock codes of the products you want to watch by searching `the Countdown site <https://shop.countdown.co.nz/>`_.  The stock code of a product is listed in the URL of its details page. For example, the stock code for the product at ``https://shop.countdown.co.nz/Shop/ProductDetails?stockcode=214684&name=colgate-360-toothbrush-medium-whole-mouth-clean`` is ``214684``.
        
        #. Put your stock codes into a YAML watchlist along with your email address and a name for the watchlist.  The watchlist ---call it ``watchlist.yaml``--- should have the form::
        
            name: my_favorites
            email_addresses:
              - brainbummer@mailinator.com
              - rhymedude@mailinator.com
            products: |

              organic cheese,281739
              GB chocolate,260803
              Lupi olive oil,701829
              Earthcare double toilet paper,381895
              Dijon mustard,700630
        
        #. Use the ``countdowner`` library functions as in the IPython notebook at ``ipynb/examples.ipynb`` or run ``countdownit --help`` from the command line for information on the command line tool.  To use the emailing functionality of ``countdowner``, you'll need a (free) `Mailgun account <https://mailgun.com>`_.

        Notes
        ======
        - Development status is Alpha
        - This project uses semantic versioning
        - I might extend this to New World stores once they roll out `more online shopping <http://www.newworld.co.nz/online-shopping/>`_
        - Will replace ``grequests`` with a faster asynchronous HTTP requester as soon as someone makes one for ``trio``

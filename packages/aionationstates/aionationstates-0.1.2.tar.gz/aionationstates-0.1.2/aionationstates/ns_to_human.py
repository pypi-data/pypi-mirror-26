"""Contains impractical to obtain otherwise static data about NationStates.

I'd love to be able to request it from the API each time as opposed
to storing it, but NS makes it extremely difficult with the awkward
one-scale-at-a-time Census data interface and the buggy banner shard.

I claim no ownership over the NationStates content and really really
hope my usage of it can be considered Fair Use.

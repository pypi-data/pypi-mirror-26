            "The 3PX-series protocol droid were third-degree protocol droids
            produced by Cybot Galactica in 50 BBY and based on the design of the
            company's 3PO-series protocol droid."

        **mr3px** is a library of line-based `custom
        protocols <http://packages.python.org/mrjob/protocols.html#custom-protocols>`__
        for use with the `mrjob <http://packages.python.org/mrjob/>`__ library.
        
        Installing
        ----------

        ::
        
            pip install mr3px

        Contributing
        ------------
        
        **mr3px** is about the easiest Open Source project to contribute to.
        Just submit a class that can read and write an existing line-based
        format, and you've made a useful contribution.
        
        Some guidelines for contributions:
        
        -  put the code for your format in ``mrjob/<format name>.py``
        -  the name of your protocol class(es) should end in ``Protocol``
        -  if your protocol class(es) only handle single values (rather than
           key-value pairs), their name should end in ``ValueProtocol``
        -  include tests, in ``tests/test_<format name>.py``. At least one test
           should inherit from ``tests.roundtrip.RoundTripTestCase``.
        -  external dependencies are fine, but should be optional; add them to
           ``extras_require`` in ``setup.py``.

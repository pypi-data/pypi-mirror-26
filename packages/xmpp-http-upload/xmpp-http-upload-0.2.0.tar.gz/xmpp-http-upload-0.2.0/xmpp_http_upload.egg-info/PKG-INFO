Description: XMPP HTTP Upload Service
        ########################
        
        This provides a Flask-based HTTP service which can be used with
        `mod_http_upload_external <https://modules.prosody.im/mod_http_upload_external.html>`_.
        
        Configuration
        =============
        
        The configuration file is specified using the environment variable
        ``XMPP_HTTP_UPLOAD_CONFIG``. It must contain the full path to the configuration
        file.
        
        The configuration file must contain the following keys:
        
        ``SECRET_KEY``
            A ``bytes`` object which is the shared secret between the Prosody module
            and this service. See the `mod_http_upload_external documentation
            <https://modules.prosody.im/mod_http_upload_external.html>`_ for details.
        
        ``DATA_ROOT``
            Path to the directory where the service stores the uploaded files.
        
        ``NON_ATTACHMENT_MIME_TYPES``
            A list of string globs which specify the content types which are *not* sent
            as attachment. Defaults to the empty list if not given.
        
            Example use::
        
                NON_ATTACHMENT_MIME_TYPES = [
                    "image/*",
                    "video/*",
                    "audio/*",
                    "text/plain",
                ]
        
            Everything which does not match any of the entries here will be sent with
            ``Content-Disposition: attachment`` in order to prevent funny attacks.
        
            It is not recommended to add things like ``text/html`` or ``*`` to this
            list.

<h1>TODO</h1>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>There are several aspects in this process than are very OS-dependent. For instance:</dt>
<dd><ul class="first simple">
<li>Copying files</li>
<li>The systax for absolute paths</li>
<li>Extraction of volume id</li>
</ul>
<p class="last">For now, I&#8217;ve been working on Windows, and I even had to implement at least an ugly hack (to handle +260 chars absolute paths, which
surprisingly causes problems in Windows). I wish it worked for Linux as well, at least, that is the very first thing I&#8217;d like to do.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
<li><p class="first">It seems not all filesystems have volume serialNumber. For that reason it seems that using disk serial numbers instead might be an improvement.
I chose volume serialnumbers because it was easy to extract, while the drive serial number containing a volume seemed hard to get (Googled for a while,
found no easy path).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For now, the only way to retrieve information from the volumes is the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">checkout</span></code> command, which rebuilds a folder/subfolder recursively. However, it would be
easy to add filters to recover only files that match a given regular expression, or filter them for timestamp or other features, etc.</p>
<p>Truth be told, this kind of operation is what I implemented for the case in which something <em>goes wrong</em>: content was deleted unwantingly, or the disk just crashed.
Fortunately those events happen pretty rarely, so little effort was dedicated to the recovery of information.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If the <code class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">updateVolume</span></code> is aborted, I am not sure whether it is possible that a file could be partially written in the volume. I wonder if it could happen that, after
such event, the system thinks that file is correctly backed-up, when it is not. I should try to provoke this event and see what happens. In that case, maybe same kind
of <em>write-and-check-size</em> or something like that might be in order.</p>

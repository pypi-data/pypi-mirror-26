        History
        =======
        
        0.5.1 (2017-11-17)
        ------------------
        
        * Argument ``--fields`` was added. You can use it to specify which fields
          should be printed to stdout. By default, all fields are printed.
        * Fixed error with parsing entries where fields contains ``time`` key
          with non string value.
        
        0.5.0 (2017-11-14)
        ------------------
        
        * Now jsail searches fields dict not only in key ``@fields``, but also
          in ``fields``.
        * Fixed precendence of fields searched for item's timestamp. Previously,
          item found in ``@timestamp`` can be overwritten by value from
          ``time``. Now these fields are searched in this order and first found
          value is used:
        
          - ``@timestamp``
          - ``timestamp``
          - ``time``
          - ``(@fields | fields).timestamp``
          - ``(@fields | fields).time``
        
        
        0.4.0 (2017-05-18)
        ------------------
        
        * Unbuffered stdin usage was fixed and now program
          exists correctly if it encounter EOF.
        
        0.3.0 (2016-10-03)
        ------------------
        
        * Now jsail recognizes as timestamp keys ``timestamp``,
          ``time``, ``@fields.timestamp``, ``@fields.time``.
          And similarly, for message these keys are checked:
          ``message``, ``msg``, ``@fields.message``, ``@fields.msg``.
        * Now jsail quietly skips lines which can't be parsed
          as single JSON document.
        
        0.2.1 (2016-03-13)
        ------------------
        
        * Fixed issue with STDIN bufering. Previously,
          input given from STDIN was buffered and sometimes
          ``jsail`` didn't show content until buffer fills up.
          Now this behaviour is fixed.
        
        0.2.0 (2015-07-06)
        ------------------
        
        * 'anyjson' was added into the requrements list.
        * Now jsail will process STDIN if filename wasn't given as a command line argument. This makes possible to use it in unix pipelines.
        
        0.1.0 (2015-04-16)
        ---------------------
        
        * First release on PyPI.

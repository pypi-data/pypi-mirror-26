cti-pattern-validator
=====================

This is an `OASIS Open Repository
<https://www.oasis-open.org/resources/open-repositories/>`__.
See the `Governance <#governance>`__ section for more information.

The STIX 2 Pattern Validator is a software tool for checking the syntax
of the Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) STIX Pattern expressions, which
are used within STIX to express conditions (represented with the Cyber
Observable data model) that indicate particular cyber threat activity.
The repository contains source code, an ANTLR grammar, automated tests
and associated documentation for the tool. The validator can be used as
a command-line tool or as a Python library which can be included in
other applications.

Requirements
------------

-  `Python <https://www.python.org>`__ 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, or 3.6
-  ANTLR grammar runtime (4.7 or newer):

   -  `antlr4-python2-runtime <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/antlr4-python2-runtime>`__
      (Python 2.7)
   -  `antlr4-python3-runtime <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/antlr4-python3-runtime>`__
      (Python 3)

-  `enum34 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/enum34>`__ (Python 3.3)
-  `six <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/six>`__
-  `typing <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/typing>`__ (Python 3.0-3.4)

Installation
------------

Using `pip <https://pip.pypa.io>`__ is highly recommended:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install stix2-patterns

For more information about installing Python packages, see the `Python
Packaging User Guide <https://packaging.python.org/installing/>`__.

Usage
-----

The STIX Pattern Validator provides an executable script
(``validate-patterns``) in addition to being an importable Python
library.

The ``validate-patterns`` script accepts patterns from either direct
user input or a file passed as an option.

>From Python Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``run_validator`` function can be called on any Python string. It
returns a list of errors encountered while parsing the pattern.

.. code:: python

    from stix2patterns.validator import run_validator

    pattern = "[file-object:hashes.md5 = '79054025255fb1a26e4bc422aef54eb4']"
    errors = run_validator(pattern)

User Input
~~~~~~~~~~

When prompted, enter a pattern to validate and press enter. The
validator will supply whether the pattern has passed or failed. If the
pattern fails the test, the validator will supply where the first syntax
error occurred. The validator will continue to prompt for patterns until
Ctrl-C is pressed. Example:

.. code:: bash

    $ validate-patterns

    Enter a pattern to validate: [file-object:hashes.md5 = '79054025255fb1a26e4bc422aef54eb4']

    PASS: [file-object:hashes.md5 = '79054025255fb1a26e4bc422aef54eb4']

File Input
~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: bash

    $ validate-patterns -f <path_to_file>

Use <path\_to\_file> to specify the path to a file containing a set of
patterns to validate. Each pattern must be on a separate line of the
file so that the validator may determine where the pattern begins and
ends. The validator will supply the PASS/FAIL result of each pattern.

Testing
-------

The STIX Pattern Validator's test suite can be run with
`pytest <http://pytest.org>`__.

You can also test against the examples provided in the supplied
``examples.txt`` file.

.. code:: bash

    $ validate-patterns -f stix2patterns/test/spec_examples.txt

Updating the Grammar
--------------------

The ANTLR pattern grammar is maintained in the
`stix2-json-schemas <https://github.com/oasis-open/cti-stix2-json-schemas/blob/master/pattern_grammar/STIXPattern.g4>`__
repository. If the grammar changes, the code in this repository should
be updated to match. To do so, use the Java ANTLR package to generate
new Python source files. (The .jar file is not needed for normal use of
the validator).

1. Download antlr-4.7-complete.jar from http://www.antlr.org/download/
2. Clone the stix2-json-schemas repository or download the
   STIXPattern.g4 file.
3. Change to the directory containing the STIXPattern.g4 file.
4. Run the following command

   .. code:: bash

       $ java -jar "/path/to/antlr-4.7-complete.jar" -Dlanguage=Python2 STIXPattern.g4 -o /path/to/cti-pattern-validator/stix2patterns/grammars

5. Commit the resulting files to git.

# A2D-Diary

**A2D-Diary** is a web app that helps you to create multiple-choice questionnaires/diaries that can be marked automatically and transcribed to a digital CSV file. This web app was developed as part of the SKIP project at the Interaction Analysis and Modelling (IAM) Lab of the University of Manchester, UK.

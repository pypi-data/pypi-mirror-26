Infinity Note Compiler
======================

Infinity is a platform-independent system for executables and shared
libraries to expose functionality to debug, monitoring, and analysis
tooling.

In Infinity, executable and shared library files contain *Infinity
notes* in addition to their regular contents.  Each Infinity note
contains a function encoded in a platform-independent instruction
set that note-consuming tools can load and execute.

This package provides I8C, a compiler for creating object files
containing Infinity notes.  This package also provides I8X, an
execution environment that can be used to create unit tests for
compiled notes.


Installation
------------

The easiest way to install I8C and I8X is to use pip::

  pip install -U --user i8c

or::

  sudo pip install -U i8c

Either of those commands will install both I8C and I8X.  If you don’t
have pip please refer to `installing pip`_.  Hint: try one of these
commands::

  sudo apt-get install python-pip
  sudo yum install python-pip

The latest development versions of I8C and I8X are available from
GitLab_.  To build and install from source use setup.py::

  python setup.py install --user

or::

  sudo python setup.py install

I8C and I8X require Python 2.6 or newer.


License

I8C is licensed under the terms of the GNU General Public License,
either `version 3`_ of the License, or (at your option) any later
version.

I8X is licensed under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License, either `version 2.1`_ of the License, or (at your option)
any later version.

I8X loads user-supplied note testcases into itself, making a combined
work.  The LGPL allows note testcases to be licensed however their
authors choose.

For the avoidance of doubt, I8C does not make a combined work with
its input.  I8C’s input may also be licensed however its authors
choose.


Note Compiler
-------------

The note compiler’s standard mode of operation is to translate
source code into object files which can be linked into executables
or shared libraries in the usual manner.  This example will
generate the file |factorial.o|::

  cd examples/factorial
  i8c -c factorial.i8

I8C uses GCC both to preprocess its input (unless invoked with
|-fpreprocessed|) and to assemble its output (unless invoked with
|-E| or |-S|).  If GCC is used, all options not explicitly listed
by |i8c --help| will be passed to GCC unmodified.  In general I8C
operates like GCC, so if you’re used to using GCC then I8C should
make sense.


Execution Environment
---------------------

I8X is an execution environment for testing Infinity notes.  When
invoked as |i8x --quick| (or |i8x -q|) I8X executes a single note
function, taking arguments from the command line and displaying the
result on the console::

  cd examples/factorial
  i8x -i factorial.o -q "example::factorial(i)i" 5

When invoked without |-q| or |--quick| I8X expects one or more note
testcases to be specified on the command line.  Note testcases are
written in Python using an extension of the unittest_ unit testing
framework.  Testcases execute note functions with specific inputs and
check the operation and result of the call proceeds as expected.  This
example tests the |factorial.o| object file created in the first
example above::

  cd examples/factorial
  i8x -i factorial.o test-factorial.py


Documentation
-------------

Documentation for Infinity is currently being put together on the
`Infinity wiki`_.  Good starting points are I8Language_ and NoteFormat_.

Right now there’s no documentation for I8C and I8X aside from this
file and what you see in |i8c --help| and |i8x --help|.  This is
being worked on!

# I see in your eyes the same fear that would take the heart of me.
# A day may come when the courage of Men fails, when we forsake our friends and break all bonds of fellowship.
# But it is not this day.
# An hour of wolves and shattered shields when the age of men comes crashing down.
# But it is not this day.
# This day we fight!
# By all that you hold dear on this good earth, I bid you stand, Men of the West!

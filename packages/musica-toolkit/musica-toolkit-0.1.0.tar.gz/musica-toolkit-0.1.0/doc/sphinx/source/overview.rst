How does Musica compare to Music21 ?
------------------------------------

Music21 is an impressive music theory Python package, but it seems to be developed by a research
team to perform musicology researches.  This aim has a strong implication on the way Music21 was
developed.

In comparison Musica has a different audience, since it is not actually designed to do musicology
researches.  I also have a different background since I have a strong scientific and software
development background, rather than an expertise in musicology.

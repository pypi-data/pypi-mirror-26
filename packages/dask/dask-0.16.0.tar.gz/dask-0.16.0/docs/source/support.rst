Contact and Support
===================

Where to ask for help
---------------------

Dask conversation happens in the following places:

1.  `StackOverflow #dask tag`_: for usage questions
2.  `Github Issue Tracker`_: for new features or established bugs
3.  `Gitter chat`_: for real-time discussion among developers

For usage questions and bug reports we strongly prefer the use of StackOverflow
and Github issues respectively over Gitter chat.  Github and StackOverflow are
more easily searchable by future users and so is more efficient for everyone's
time.  Gitter chat is strictly reserved for developer and community discussion.

When asking questions it is ideal to create `minimal, complete, verifiable
examples <https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve>`_.  This significantly reduces
the time that answerers spend understanding your situation and so usually
results in higher quality answers much more quickly.

        ## Overview
        
        **vsphere-guest-run** enables executing programs in the guest operating system of virtual machines running on vSphere. It also enables working with directories and files. The operations are done through ESX host and guest communication channel and therefore network connectivity to the virtual machine is not required. vCenter and guest OS credentials are required. It is distributed as a package with a Python library and CLI.

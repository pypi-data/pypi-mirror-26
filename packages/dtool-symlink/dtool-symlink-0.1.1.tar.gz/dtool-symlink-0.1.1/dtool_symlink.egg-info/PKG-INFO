Description: README
        ======
        
        Add ability to create dataset where data directory is a symlink.
        
        Installing this package provides the dtool command line client with a storage
        broker named ``symlink``. This is useful if one wants to mark up files in a
        directory as a dataset without having to re-organise their structure on disk.
        For example if one wants to mark up some Next Generation Sequencing data that
        has arrived on an external hard disk as a dataset before copying the resulting
        dataset to some other form of storage.
        
        If one wants to make use of the
        ``dtool_symlink.storagebroker.SymLinkStorageBroker`` class programatically one
        needs to create a function that returns the data directory to be symbolically
        linked. This function is then passed into the
        ``SymLinkStorageBroker.create_structure()`` method. For example::
        
            from dtool_symlink.storagebroker import SymLinkStorageBroker
        
            def get_data_dir():
                return "/my/path/with/data"
        
            symlink_storage_broker = SymLinkStorageBroker("/path/to/dataset")
            symlink_storage_broker.create_structure(get_data_dir)

The tests require access to a blank database named ``testing``
with the user ``tester`` and password ``tester``. This can easily
be created using the following commands::

    psql -c "CREATE USER tester WITH SUPERUSER PASSWORD 'tester';"
    createdb -O tester testing

The tests can then be run using::

    make test

Or::

    pip install -r requirements/test.txt
    py.test

Installation instructions for Larch
========================================

To install the Larch, use::

   python setup.py build
   python setup.py install

On modern linux and OS X systems, you will probably need to install with super-user
privileges, as with::

   python setup.py build
   sudo python setup.py install

Requirements and Dependencies
===============================

Python:
~~~~~~~

Larch requires Python 2.6 or higher.  Python 2.7 is *STRONGLY* recommended,
unless you have no choice.  Moderate testing has been done with Python 3.2,
but not all modules (notably, wx) are available for it at this writing
(Jan 2013).  At some point in the future, Larch will probably switch to
Python 3, possibly to only supporting use from Python 3.

Several Python packages are needed for Larch.  All of these are easily
installed, either as binary installs for Windows or Mac OS X, or as part of
your systems Package Management System for linux.  In addition, most of
these are easily installed from source or using Python's easy_install
script (see Using easy_install below)

Note that some Python distributions come with many of the required and
strongly recommended modules already installed.

Using easy_install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python has an easy-to-use program to install libraries called easy_install.
If you don't have easy_install already installed, it is also easy to
install.  For Windows, there is an executable installer
setuptools-06c11.win32-py2.7.exe, and for Linux and Mac OS X there is a
setuptools-0.6c11.tar.gz file in the dependencies directory.  For Linux and
Mac OS X, do:
    ~> cd dependencies
    ~> tar xvzf setuptools-0.6c11.tar.gz
    ~> cd setuptools-0.6c11
    ~> python setup.py build
    ~> sudo python setup.py install

For windows, easy_install is installed in C:\Python2.7\Scripts\easy_install.exe
for linux, it is put in /usr/bin, and for Mac OS X, somewhere like
/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/bin/easy_install

If this is placed in your path (or copied to your path), then many python
packages can be installed with
    ~> easy_install -U packagename

For Windows, many packages have binary installers -- these are generally
preferred, as easy_install will try to compile any C or Fortran parts of
the library.

Required Modules: Numpy and Scipy and Docutils
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Numpy and Scipy Packages are both required for Larch to work.
These are available from http://scipy.org.  For Windows, install binaries.

Docutils can be found at http://pypi.python.org/pypi/docutils, and can be
installed via easy_install.

Strongly Recommended Modules: wxPython, matplotlib, and wxmplot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These modules are required for plotting data.

They are all available as simple installs:

  wxPython:   http://www.wxpython.org/download.php
  matplotlib: http://sourceforge.net/projects/matplotlib/files/matplotlib/
  wxmplot:    https://github.com/newville/wxmplot

The wxPython 2.8 series is required.  The 2.9 series is recommended, and is required
on 64-bit Mac OS X.

Matplotlib can be installed from binaries or via easy_install, but does need a C compiler.

WXMplot is pure python and can be install as binaries or with easy_install
on all systems.

Recommended Modules: sqlalchemy, h5py, epics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to use data from the x-ray databases, the SQLAlchemy module must
be installed.  This con be installed with
   ~>easy_install -U sqlalchemy

In order to read HDF5 files, the h5py package is needed. See
http://code.google.com/p/h5py/.  This can be installed with:
   ~>easy_install -U h5py

though this needs working C (and Fortran?) compilers.

Optional Modules: epics
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The PyEpics module provides support for interacting with the Epics control system.
The python module is pure Python (and so can be installed with easy_install), but
requires the base Epics Channel Access library to be installed to actually work.

What is Installed
===========================

The Larch installation process puts several files and directories on your computer.
A basic set of Python modules will be placed in the standard Python location on your
machine, at locations like these:

  /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/larch   on linux
  C:\Python2.7\libs\site-packages\larch    on Windows
  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/Current/lib/python2.7/site-packages/larch   on Mac OS X

The larch executable (or larch.bat) will be installed to

  /usr/bin/larch               on linux
  C:\Python2.7\bin\larch.bat   on Windows
  /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/2.7/bin/larch on Mac OS X

In addition, a directory is made for system-wide larch files, including
larch modules and plugins.  This directory will be

   /usr/share/larch/           on linux and Mac OS X
   C:\Program Files\larch      on Windows

and will contain larch modules in a modules subdirectoy, and several larch
plugins in the plugins sub-directory.

Finally, a directory is made for user-specific larch files, including an
initialization script, 'init.lar', to be run at startup, a history file,
'history.lar', containing the command history for past larch sessions, and
folders named 'matplotlib', 'modules', and 'plugins'.  The 'matplotlib'
folder may be used by the plotting libraries, for example to store fonts.
The 'modules' and 'plugins' folders are the place to put user-specific
modules and plugins, respectively.

On linux and Mac OS X, the larch directory will be called '.larch'.  On
Windows it will be 'larch'.The exact location of your larch directory
varies from system to system, but should be in one of

  /Users/USERRNAME/.larch
  /home/USERNAME/.larch
  C:\Users\USERNAME\larch
  C:\ProgramData\larch


Customization of Installation
===============================

The location of the the system-wide and per-user larch directories can be
configured by editing the simple file lib/site_configdata.py.
Currently, this file looks like this::

   unix_installdir = '/usr/share/larch'
   unix_userdir    = '.larch'

   win_installdir = 'C:\\Program Files\\larch'
   win_userdir    = 'larch'

You can customize the installed locations by adjusting these values prior
to installation.

A simple IPA tokeniser, as simple as in:

>>> from ipatok import tokenise
>>> tokenise('ˈtiːt͡ʃə')
['t', 'iː', 't͡ʃ', 'ə']


api
===

``tokenise(string, strict=True)`` takes an IPA string and returns a list of
tokens. A token usually consists of a single letter together with its
accompanying diacritics. If two letters are connected by a tie bar, they are
also considered a single token. Except for length markers, suprasegmentals are
excluded from the output.

By default the function raises a ``ValueError`` if the string does not conform
to the `IPA spec`_ (the 2015 revision). Invoking it with ``strict=False`` makes
it accept some common replacements such as ``g`` and ``ɫ``.

``tokenize(string, strict=True)`` is an alias for the ``tokenise`` function.


installation
============

This is a standard Python 3 package without dependencies. It is offered at `the
Cheese Shop`_, so you can install it with pip::

    pip install ipatok

or, alternatively, you can clone this repo (safe to delete afterwards) and do::

    python setup.py test
    python setup.py install

Of course, this could be happening within a virtualenv/venv as well.

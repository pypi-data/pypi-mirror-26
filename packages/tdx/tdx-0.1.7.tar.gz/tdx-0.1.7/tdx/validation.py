    """
    Check that the keys of dictionary `d` are as expected. Raises an error when
    there are keys mismatches, which can be customized with the `descr` input.

    PARAMETERS
    ----------
    d : dict
       A dictionary to validate
    required : iterable
       An iterable of required keys. We raise an error if `d` is missing any
       of these.
    allowed : {iterable, ANY, None}
       Either `tdx.validation.ANY`, an iterable of allowed keys, or None.
       If `ANY`, then we only check required keys (i.e. unknown keys do not
       cause any errors). If an iterable, then we raise an error if `d` has any
       keys not here. If `None`, then the set of allowed keys will be inferred
       from `required` and `optional`
    optional : {iterable, None}, optional
       An iterable of optional keys. You may specify this as an alternative to
       `allowed`, but you may not give non-`None` values for both of them. If
       both `allowed` and `optional` are `None`, then we will raise whenever
       `d`s keys do not match `required` exactly.
    descr : string, optional
       A description of the object being validated. Used in the error
       message.

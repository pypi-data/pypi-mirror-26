Description: Large Print Splitter
        ====================
        
        Takes an image, printed height or width (in mm) and page size then
        splits image across multiple pages with alignment marks and generates a
        PDF.
        
        It is intended for printing projections exported as SVGs from Openscad.
        
        For the image it supports anything that Pillow supports, as well as SVGs
        thanks to CairoSVG.
        
        PDF generation is done by ReportLab.

            $ lps -h
            usage: lps [-h] (--width WIDTH | --height HEIGHT) [--page_size PAGE_SIZE]
                       [--overlap OVERLAP] [--margins MARGINS] [--outfile OUTFILE]
                       [--svg_start_scale SVG_START_SCALE]
                       image_file
        
            positional arguments:
              image_file            Image to parse
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              --width WIDTH         Width of image in millimeters
              --height HEIGHT       Height of image in millimeters
              --page_size PAGE_SIZE
                                    Page size, e.g. a3, a4
              --overlap OVERLAP     Print overlap in mm
              --margins MARGINS     Print margins in mm
              --outfile OUTFILE     Filename to save pdf to
              --svg_start_scale SVG_START_SCALE
                                    When using SVG, this is the largest scale factor to
                                    attempt to generate an image
        
            $ lps --width 970 --page_size a3 --overlap 20 wrap.svg
            Loading Image
            Trying to generate raster image of svg at 3x scale
            The image will not fit on a single page
            Calculating crop list
            This will require 3 pages

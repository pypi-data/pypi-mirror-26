# PySplash

- Small interface for splash written in python.<br />
*https://github.com/scrapinghub/splash*

- Idea is to look similar to Ghost.py and Dryscrape.<br />
https://github.com/jeanphix/Ghost.py<br />
https://github.com/niklasb/dryscrape

## Usage examples
``` python
from py_splash.driver import Driver

splash_driver = Driver()

url = 'random_url'
condition = [
    "//div[@class='splash']",
    "//a[@href='PySplash']"
]

splash_url = splash_driver.wait_for_condition(url=url, condition=condition)
```

In example above lua script is generated and added to splash_url as query param.
That url contains all info needed for splash to wait for desired html tags that are added in condition.

## Requirements
Latest splash version and any version of python after 2.7 .

## Installation
```pip install py_splash```

## ToDo
- add an option to wait for certain url (if possible)
- add simple `go` method that will just go to page and won't wait for any condition
- add methods for get and post request that will not load page content into browser

## Docs
For now there is no docs. <br />
For detailed info go to **PySplash/py_splash/driver.py** .

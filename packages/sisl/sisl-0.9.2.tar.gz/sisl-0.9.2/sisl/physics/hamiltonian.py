    It contains an intrinsic sparse matrix of the Hamiltonian elements.

    Assigning or changing Hamiltonian elements is as easy as with
    standard `numpy` assignments:

    >>> ham.H[1,2] = 0.1 # doctest: +SKIP

        Creation and return of the Hamiltonian for a given k-point (default to Gamma).

        Notes
        -----

        Currently the implemented gauge for the k-point is the cell vector gauge:

        .. math::
          H(k) = H_{ij} e^{i k R}

        where :math:`R` is an integer times the cell vector and :math:`i`, :math:`j` are orbital indices.

        Another possible gauge is the orbital distance which can be written as

        .. math::
          H(k) = H_{ij} e^{i k r}

        where :math:`r` is the distance between the orbitals :math:`i` and :math:`j`.
        Currently the second gauge is not implemented (yet).

        Parameters
        ----------
        k : array_like
           the k-point to setup the Hamiltonian at
        dtype : numpy.dtype , optional
           the data type of the returned matrix. Do NOT request non-complex
           data-type for non-Gamma k.
           The default data-type is `numpy.complex128`
        gauge : {'R', 'r'}
           the chosen gauge, `R` for cell vector gauge, and `r` for orbital distance
           gauge.
        format : {'csr', 'array', 'dense', 'coo', ...}
           the returned format of the matrix, defaulting to the ``scipy.sparse.csr_matrix``,
           however if one always requires operations on dense matrices, one can always
           return in `numpy.ndarray` (`'array'`) or `numpy.matrix` (`'dense'`).

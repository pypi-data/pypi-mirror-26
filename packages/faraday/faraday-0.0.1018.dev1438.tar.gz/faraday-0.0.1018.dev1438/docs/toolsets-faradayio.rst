FaradayIO Toolset Documentation
================

The Faraday IO toolset is a collection of Python scripts that perform input/output, packet creation, packet parsing, and other functions that provide a basic level of interaction with a Faraday digital radio. This module is specifically designed to be used in the creation of applications that wish to interact with a Faraday device over the localhost proxy server RESTful API.

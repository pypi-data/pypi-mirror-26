        A taxonomy browser for ploneintranet
        
        Features
        --------
        
        - Allows browsing through a hierarchical taxonomy
        - Supports search on taxonomy and on content within
        - Dedicated search and group view for each taxonomy term
        
        
        Background
        ----------
        
        The app has been discussed and specified at
        - https://github.com/quaive/ploneintranet.prototype/issues/272
        
        
        Documentation
        -------------
        
        Full documentation for end users can be found in the "docs" folder, and is also available online at http://docs.quaive.net
        
        
        Translations
        ------------
        
        This product has been translated into
        
        - German (thanks, Angela Merkel)
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        Install quaive.app.taxonomy by adding it to your buildout::
        
            [buildout]
        
            ...
        
            eggs =
                quaive.app.taxonomy
        
        
        Your Quaive instance will need to register a vdex vocabulary and add the identifier of that vocabulary to the solr index configuration.
        
        Run buildout to update your instance: ``bin/buildout``
        
        Add the vocabulary identifier to following registry entries::
        
          ploneintranet.search.filter_fields
          ploneintranet.search.facet_fields
        
        Add an adapter to configure an app tile, see quaive/app/taxonomy/tests/configure.zcml for an example.

        Fixes:
        
        - Fix injection target [pilz]
        
        
        1.1 (2016-09-08)
        ----------------
        
        Fixes/New features:
        
        - Sort grouped results by title
        - Add search grouping by workspace and author
        - sidebar-search: use solr instead of the catalog
          The normal Sidebar view uses the catalog, presumably to avoid the delay
          caused by asynchronous indexing with solr.
        - sidebar-search: handle unicode vocab terms
        - Add the option to configure a separate vocab index
          This allows the search index to have a different id from the
          vocabulary. It's configured on the app_parameters e.g.
          {'vocabulary_index': 'someidx'}
        - Also search by vocab terms
        - Implement sidebar search
          Design: quaive/ploneintranet.prototype#272
        - Updated to app objects
          Also, the vocabulary does not need to be passed as a GET parameter any
          more, since it is now defined in the app_parameters.
        - Include documents in the sidebar, implement search
        - Improved testing, better handling of values
        
        
        1.0a1 (2016-07-16)
        ------------------
        
        - Initial release.

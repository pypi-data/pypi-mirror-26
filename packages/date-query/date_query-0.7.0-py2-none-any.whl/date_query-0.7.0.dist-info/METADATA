A date query program
====================

This is a date query program. It is in its initial stages. Currently, it
supports requests for the first occurrence of a given weekday for a given year.

The need for this program arose when I needed to provide a list of dates to
someone to schedule a year's worth of meetings on the first Tuesday of
every month.

Description: A date query program
        ====================
        
        This is a date query program. It is in its initial stages. Currently, it
        supports requests for the first occurrence of a given weekday for a given year.
        
        The need for this program arose when I needed to provide a list of dates to
        someone to schedule a year's worth of meetings on the first Tuesday of
        every month.

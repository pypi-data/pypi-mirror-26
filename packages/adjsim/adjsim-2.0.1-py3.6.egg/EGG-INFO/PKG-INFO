Description: AdjSim Simulation Framework
        ===========================
        
        |Build Status| |Coverage Status| |License: GPL v3|
        
        A simulation framework. Intended for simulation of ecosystems.
        
            Designed and developed by Sever Topan
        
        Features
        --------
        
        Engine
        ~~~~~~
        
        At its core, AdjSim is an agent-based modelling engine. It allows users
        to define simulation environments through which agents interact through
        ability casting and timestep iteration. The framework is targeted
        towards agents that behave intelligently, for example a bacterium
        chasing down food. However, the framework is extremely flexible - from
        enabling physics simulation to defining an environment in which
        `Conway's Game of
        Life <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life>`__ plays
        out! AdjSim aims to be a foundational architecture on top of which
        reinforcement learning can be built.
        
        Graphical Simulation Representation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The simulation can be viewed in real time as it unfolds, with graphics
        are rendered and animated using PyQt5. Below are four of the distinct
        examples packadged with AdjSim, ranging from bacteria to moon system
        simulation.

        Post Simulation Analysis Tools
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Agent properties can be marked for tracking during simulation, allowing
        for viewing the results of these values once the simulation completes.
        For example, we can track the population of each different type of
        agent, or the efficacy of the agent's ability to meet its intelligence
        module-defined goals.

        Intelligence Module
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Perhaps the most computationally interesting aspect of AdjSim lies in
        its intelligence module. It allows agents to set goals (for example, the
        goal of a bacterium may be to maximize its calories), and assess its
        actions in terms of its ability to meet its goals. This allows the
        agents to learn which actions are best used in a given situation.
        Currently the intelligence module implements
        `Q-Learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning>`__, but more
        advanced reinforcement learning techniques are coming soon!
        
        Installing and Running AdjSim
        -----------------------------
        
        It is reccommended to run AdjSim using virtual python environments
        provided by Anaconda or Pip. The following describes the installation
        procedure for each of these.
        
        Clone the GitHub repository.
        
        ::
        
             git clone https://github.com/SeverTopan/AdjSim
        
        Make sure Python 3.5 or greater are installed, then create a new
        environment with it.
        
        ::
        
            # If using Virtualenv
            virtualenv --python=/usr/bin/python3.6 venv
            source venv/bin/activate
        
            # If using Anaconda
            conda create --name adjsim python=3.6
            activate adjsim
        
        Install Dependencies.
        
        ::
        
             python setup.py install
        
        Note: If you run into trouble importing PyQt5 when installing using the
        setup.py file, try using
        
        ::
        
            pip install -e .

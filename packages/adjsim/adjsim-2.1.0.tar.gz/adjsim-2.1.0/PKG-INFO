        Engine
        ~~~~~~
        
        At its core, AdjSim is an agent-based modelling engine. It allows users
        to define simulation environments through which agents interact through
        ability casting and timestep iteration. The framework is targeted
        towards agents that behave intelligently, for example a bacterium
        chasing down food. However, the framework is extremely flexible - from
        enabling physics simulation to defining an environment in which
        `Conway's Game of
        Life <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life>`__ plays
        out! AdjSim aims to be a foundational architecture on top of which
        reinforcement learning can be built.
        
        Graphical Simulation Representation
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        The simulation can be viewed in real time as it unfolds, with graphics
        are rendered and animated using PyQt5. Below are four of the distinct
        examples packadged with AdjSim, ranging from bacteria to moon system
        simulation.

        Post Simulation Analysis Tools
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Agent properties can be marked for tracking during simulation, allowing
        for viewing the results of these values once the simulation completes.
        For example, we can track the population of each different type of
        agent, or the efficacy of the agent's ability to meet its intelligence
        module-defined goals.

        Intelligence Module
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Perhaps the most computationally interesting aspect of AdjSim lies in
        its intelligence module. It allows agents to set goals (for example, the
        goal of a bacterium may be to maximize its calories), and assess its
        actions in terms of its ability to meet its goals. This allows the
        agents to learn which actions are best used in a given situation.
        Currently the intelligence module implements
        `Q-Learning <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Q-learning>`__, but more
        advanced reinforcement learning techniques are coming soon!

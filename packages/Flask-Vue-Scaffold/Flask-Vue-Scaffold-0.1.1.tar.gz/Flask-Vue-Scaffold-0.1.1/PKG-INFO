        # flask-vue-scaffold
        
        Create a new [Flask](https://github.com/pallets/flask) project with a [Vue.js](https://github.com/vuejs/vue) frontend without pain.
        
        ## About
        
        `flask-vue-scaffold` helps with setting up a new project which uses Flask for the backend and Vue.js for the frontend.
        No need to spend hours getting webpack and Flask to work together for development and production.
        As a base it uses [vue-cli](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) with webpack.
        In development mode two services are started with the help of [honcho](https://github.com/nickstenning/honcho),
        the Flask server and a webpack-devserver.
        
        ## Requirements
        
        * Python3.6
        * Node
        
        ## Usage
        
        ```
        pip install flask-vue-scaffold
        flask_vue init --name my-awesome-project [--dest /path/to/workspace]
        
        cd /path/to/workspace/my-awesome-project
        pip install -e .
        yarn
        my_awesome_project devserver
        ```
        
        Start editing the backend in the `my_awesome_project` directory, frontend in `src`.

def get_yields(solution, model):
    """ Calculate the yields for the individual metabolites that are produced

    The function uses the flux values listed in the solution object to calculate
    the net flux for each individual metabolite that is part of a boundary reaction,
    where the net flux is the sum of the stoichiometric coefficient multiplied by the
    flux value of the individual boundary reaction.

    All metabolites with a net influx greater zero are considered products whereas
    all metabolites with a negative net influx are considered substrates.

    The individual fluxes for the elements are calculated by multiplying the net
    metabolite flux with the stoichiometric coefficients of the sum formula of
    the metabolites.

    The elemental fluxes are used for the calculation of yield coefficients of the
    individual elements for all relevant metabolites.

Release Notes
=============

This file contains the changes made since the last release.

v0.6.3
------

This version contains very little, it was required to work around a pypi issue.

New Features
````````````
Two new logging calls are now valid when using the CleverSheep logger, these are
'warning' and 'fatal'. This brings it more in line with the Python logging
library which is what is used under the hood.

Known Issues
````````````

- The '--timeout' command line option does not work as intended and should not be used.
- Using versions 0.7.X of twisted and higher seems to cause an import error and should not be used.

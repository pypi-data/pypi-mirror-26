Release Notes
=============

This file contains the changes made since the last release.

v0.6.4
------

If non string objects are passed in as the error message for `fail` calls a more
informative error message will be raised.

Known Issues
````````````

- The '--timeout' command line option does not work as intended and should not be used.
- Using versions 0.7.X of twisted and higher seems to cause an import error and should not be used.
- `from mock import call` will cause an exception, this seems to be due to `call` being a tuple.
  Currently there is no fix for the issue, to work around it import mock then
  use `mock.call`.

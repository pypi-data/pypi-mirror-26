Flamyngo is a customizable Flask frontend for MongoDB.

At the most basic level, the aim is to delegate most settings to a YAML
configuration file, which then allows the  underlying code to be reused for
any conceivable collection.

Detailed usage instructions are available at the project's `Github page
<https://github.com/materialsvirtuallab/flamyngo>`_.

|versions| |license| |pypi|

``wpm`` is a simple terminal program that measures your typing speed in words
per minute (WPM).

The WPM is calculated by dividing characters per second by five and then
multiplying that with 60. This is a well-known formula, but gives slightly
higher scores than on sites like typeracer.com. It is, however, good enough to
gauge your typing speed. And it works offline, and with your own texts.

How to install
==============

The recommended way is to install via PyPi

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install wpm

But you can also install from the source with

.. code:: bash

    $ python setup.py install [--user]

To just test the app without installing, type ``make run``.

How to run
==========

Just type ``wpm`` to start the program. The timer will start when you press the
first key. At any time, you can hit ESCAPE to quit.

You can backspace for the current word you're editing, if you make a mistake.
Mistakes will lower the accuracy score.

If you have problems finding the ``wpm`` file, you can also start it by typing
``python -m wpm``. You can also see options with ``python -m wpm --help``.

If you want to type a custom text, run

.. code:: bash

    $ wpm --load yourfile.txt

You can also bundle up several texts into a single JSON file, using ``wpm
--load-json yourfile.json``. It must have the following format:

.. code:: json

    [
      {
        "author": "Author Name",
        "title": "Title of Work",
        "text": "The text to type here ..."
      },
      ...
    ]

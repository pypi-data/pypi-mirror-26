grafana-dashboard-builder is an open-source tool for easier creation of Grafana dashboards.
It is written in Python and uses YAML descriptors for dashboard

This project has been inspired by Jenkins Job Builder that
allows users to describe Jenkins jobs with human-readable format. grafana-dashboard-builder
aims to provide similar simplicity to Grafana dashboard creation and to give users easy way how they can create
dashboard templates filled with different configuration.

Using the pycorn module:

# Importing the module
from pycorn import pc_res3

# Create an instance of the pycorn object, there are a couple of options that can be specified: 
#     file_name = file name of the res-file that you want to load
#     reduce = integer to only read every n sample (similar to the option found in UNICORN during export to asc)
#     inj_sel = which injection point to use as zero-rentention. By default the last injection point is used (same as in UNICORN)

# Create the instance using default options
my_res_file = pc_res3("sample1.res")

# Parse the file
my_res_file.load()

# Show available data
print(list(my_res_file.keys()))

>>>[u'CreationNotes', u'Logbook', u'UV', u'Cond', u'pH', u'Pressure', u'Temp', u'Conc', u'Fractions']

# The above list is your key to access the data inside the file
# my_res_file[key][value] value can be:
#   data: contains the actual data, either pure text or a list with x/y-pairs as tuples
#   unit: the unit for this data block (mAu, ms/cm etc.)
#   run_name: an internal name (like "Manual Run 8")

# For example to read-out the the unit for the UV-block:
my_res_file['UV']['unit']

# To read the actual UV-data:
x = my_res_file['UV']['data']
print(x[0:3])
>>>[(0.0, -9.22), (0.06, -0.007), (0.13, -0.004)]

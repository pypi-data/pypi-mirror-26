A script extract data from .res (results) files generated by UNICORN Chromatography software supplied with AKTA Systems. This script will find all data blocks, extract the data and write out csv-files. If you have matplotlib installed it will also plot all the curves including fractions if present. Plots can be saved in any format supported by matplotlib (default is pdf). Alternatively you may import pycorn into your script and access the data inside res-files.

pep8's documentation
====================

.. note::

    This package used to be called `pep8 <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8/1.7.0>`_ 
    but was renamed to `pycodestyle <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pycodestyle/2.2.0>`_
    to reduce confusion. Further discussion can be found `in the issue where
    Guido requested this
    change <https://github.com/PyCQA/pycodestyle/issues/466>`_, or in the
    lightning talk at PyCon 2016 by @IanLee1521:
    `slides <https://speakerdeck.com/ianlee1521/pep8-vs-pep-8>`_
    `video <https://youtu.be/PulzIT8KYLk?t=36m>`_.

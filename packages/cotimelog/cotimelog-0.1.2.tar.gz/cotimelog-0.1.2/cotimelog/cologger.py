    Handler for logging to a set of files, which switches from one file to the
    next when the current file reaches a certain size. Multiple processes can
    write to the log file concurrently, but this may mean that the file will
    exceed the given size.
    """
    def __init__(self, filename, mode='a', when='h', backupCount=0, utc=False,
                 encoding=None, debug=True, delay=0, **kwargs):
        """
        Open the specified file and use it as the stream for logging.

        By default, the file grows indefinitely. You can specify particular
        values of maxBytes and backupCount to allow the file to rollover at
        a predetermined size.

        Rollover occurs whenever the current log file is nearly maxBytes in
        length. If backupCount is >= 1, the system will successively create
        new files with the same pathname as the base file, but with extensions
        ".1", ".2" etc. appended to it. For example, with a backupCount of 5
        and a base file name of "app.log", you would get "app.log",
        "app.log.1", "app.log.2", ... through to "app.log.5". The file being
        written to is always "app.log" - when it gets filled up, it is closed
        and renamed to "app.log.1", and if files "app.log.1", "app.log.2" etc.
        exist, then they are renamed to "app.log.2", "app.log.3" etc.
        respectively.

        If maxBytes is zero, rollover never occurs.

        On Windows, it is not possible to rename a file that is currently opened
        by another process.  This means that it is not possible to rotate the
        log files if multiple processes is using the same log file.  In this
        case, the current log file will continue to grow until the rotation can
        be completed successfully.  In order for rotation to be possible, all of
        the other processes need to close the file first.  A mechanism, called
        "degraded" mode, has been created for this scenario.  In degraded mode,
        the log file is closed after each log message is written.  So once all
        processes have entered degraded mode, the net rotation attempt should
        be successful and then normal logging can be resumed.  Using the 'delay'
        parameter may help reduce contention in some usage patterns.

        This log handler assumes that all concurrent processes logging to a
        single file will are using only this class, and that the exact same
        parameters are provided to each instance of this class.  If, for
        example, two different processes are using this class, but with
        different values for 'maxBytes' or 'backupCount', then odd behavior is
        expected. The same is true if this class is used by one application, but
        the RotatingFileHandler is used by another.

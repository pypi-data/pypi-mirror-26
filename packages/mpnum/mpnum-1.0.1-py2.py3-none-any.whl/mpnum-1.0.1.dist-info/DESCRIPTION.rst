[MPNUM]

A matrix product representation library for Python

mpnum is a flexible, user-friendly, and expandable toolbox for the
matrix product state/tensor train tensor format. mpnum provides:

-   support for well-known matrix product representations, such as:
-   matrix product states (MPS), also known as tensor trains (TT)
-   matrix product operators (MPO)
-   local purification matrix product states (PMPS)
-   arbitrary matrix product arrays (MPA)
-   arithmetic operations: addition, multiplication, contraction etc.
-   compression, canonical forms, etc.
-   finding extremal eigenvalues and eigenvectors of MPOs (DMRG)
-   flexible tools for new matrix product algorithms

Description: [MPNUM]
        
        A matrix product representation library for Python
        
        mpnum is a flexible, user-friendly, and expandable toolbox for the
        matrix product state/tensor train tensor format. mpnum provides:
        
        -   support for well-known matrix product representations, such as:
        -   matrix product states (MPS), also known as tensor trains (TT)
        -   matrix product operators (MPO)
        -   local purification matrix product states (PMPS)
        -   arbitrary matrix product arrays (MPA)
        -   arithmetic operations: addition, multiplication, contraction etc.
        -   compression, canonical forms, etc.
        -   finding extremal eigenvalues and eigenvectors of MPOs (DMRG)
        -   flexible tools for new matrix product algorithms

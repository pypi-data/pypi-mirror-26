        ## What is *jprofile*?
        
        *Jprofile* is a simple tool for automated profiling of large batches of *JP2* images. Internally it wraps around [*jpylyzer*](http://jpylyzer.openpreservation.org/), which is used for validating each image and for extracting its properties. The *jpylyzer* output is then validated against a set of [*Schematron*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schematron) schemas that contain the required characteristics for master, access and target images, respectively. 
        
        ## Licensing
        
        *Jprofile* is released under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/lgpl.html).
        
        ## Dependencies
        
        *Jprofile* uses the [lxml](http://lxml.de/) toolkit. You need to install this to run the software in Python. The Windows binaries of *jprofile* are completely stand-alone, and don't require the installation of lxml (or anything else).
        
        ## Installation
        
        Just unzip the contents of *jprofile_x.y.z_win32.zip* to any empty directory.
        
        ## Command-line syntax
        
        
            usage: jprofile batchDir prefixOut -p PROFILE
        
        
        ## Positional arguments
        
        **batchDir**: root directory of batch  
        
        **prefixOut**: prefix that is used for writing output files
        
        **PROFILE**: name of profile that defines schemas for master, access and target images 
        
        To list all available profiles, use a value of *l* or *list* for *PROFILE*.
        
        
        ## Profiles
        
        A *profile* is an *XML*-formatted file that simply defines which schemas are used to validate *jpylyzer*'s output for master, access and target images, respectively. Here's an example:
        
            <profile>
            
            <!-- Sample profile -->
               
            <schemaMaster>master300Gray_2014.sch</schemaMaster>
            <schemaAccess>access300Colour_2014.sch</schemaAccess>
            <schemaTarget>master300Colour_2014.sch</schemaTarget>
            
            </profile>
        
        Note that each entry only contains the *name* of a profile, not its full path! All profiles are located in the *profiles* directory in the installation folder.
        
        ## Available profiles
        
        The following profiles are included by default:
        
        | Name|Description|
        | :------| :-----|
        |kb_generic_2014.xml|Generic profile for KB digitisation streams (doesn't include any checks on resolution or colour spaces!)|
        |kb_300Colour_2014.xml|As generic profile, but with additional requirements than resolution equals 300 ppi and colour space is Adobe RGB 1998|
        |kb_300Gray_2014.xml|As generic profile, but with additional requirements than resolution equals 300 ppi and colour space is Gray Gamma 2.2|
        |kb_600Colour_2014.xml|As generic profile, but with additional requirements than resolution equals 600 ppi and colour space is Adobe RGB 1998|
        |kb_600Gray_2014.xml|As generic profile, but with additional requirements than resolution equals 360 ppi and colour space is Gray Gamma 2.2|
        
        It is possible to create custom-made profiles. Just add them to the *profiles* directory in the installation folder.   
        
        ## Schemas
        
        The quality assessment is based on a number of rules/tests that are defined a set of *Schematron* schemas. These are located in the *schemas* folder in the installation directory. In principe *any* property that is reported by *jpylyzer* can be used here, and new tests can be added by editing the schemas. More details on this can be found in [this blog post](http://openpreservation.org/knowledge/blogs/2012/09/04/automated-assessment-jp2-against-technical-profile/).  
         
        ## Available schemas
        
        | Name|Description|
        |:------| :-----|
        |kbMaster_2014.sch|Generic schema for losslessly-compressed master images according to 2014 specifications|
        |master600Colour_2014.sch|Schema for losslessly-compressed master images, 600 ppi, Adobe RGB (1998) colour space|
        |master600Gray_2014.sch|Schema for losslessly-compressed master images, 600 ppi, Gray Gamma 2.2 colour space|
        |master300Colour_2014.sch|Schema for losslessly-compressed master images, 300 ppi, Adobe RGB (1998) colour space|
        |master300Gray_2014.sch|Schema for losslessly-compressed master images, 300 ppi, Gray Gamma 2.2 colour space|
        |kbAccess_2014.sch|Generic schema for lossily-compressed access images according to 2014 specifications|
        |access600Colour_2014.sch|Schema for lossily-compressed access images, 600 ppi, Adobe RGB (1998) colour space|
        |access600Gray_2014.sch|Schema for lossily-compressed access images, 600 ppi, Gray Gamma 2.2 colour space|
        |access300Colour_2014.sch|Schema for lossily-compressed access images, 300 ppi, Adobe RGB (1998) colour space|
        |access300Gray_2014.sch|Schema for lossily-compressed access images, 300 ppi, Gray Gamma 2.2 colour space|
        
        It is possible to create custom-made schemas. Just add them to the *schemas* directory in the installation folder.
        
        ## Overview of 2014 schemas
        
        The following tables give a general overview of the technical profiles that the generic master- and access schemas are representing:
        
        ### Master
        
        |Parameter|Value|
        |:---|:---|
        |File format|JP2 (JPEG 2000 Part 1)|
        |Compression type|Reversible 5-3 wavelet filter|
        |Colour transform|Yes (only for colour images)|
        |Number of decomposition levels|5|
        |Progression order |RPCL|
        |Tile size |1024 x 1024|
        |Code block size| 64 x 64 (2<sup>6</sup> x 2<sup>6</sup>)|
        |Precinct size	|256 x 256 (2<sup>8</sup>) for 2 highest resolution levels; 128 x 128 (2<sup>7</sup>) for remaining resolution levels|
        |Number of quality layers|11|
        |Target compression ratio layers|2560:1 [1] ; 1280:1 [2] ;  640:1 [3] ; 320:1 [4] ; 160:1 [5] ; 80:1 [6] ; 40:1 [7] ; 20:1 [8] ; 10:1 [9] ; 5:1 [10] ; 2.5:1 [11]|
        |Error resilience|Start-of-packet headers; end-of-packet headers; segmentation symbols|
        |Sampling rate|Stored in "Capture Resolution" fields|
        |Capture metadata|Embedded as XMP metadata in XML box|
        
        
        ### Access
        
        |Parameter|Value|
        |:---|:---|
        |File format|JP2 (JPEG 2000 Part 1)|
        |Compression type|Irreversible 7-9 wavelet filter|
        |Colour transform|Yes (only for colour images)|
        |Number of decomposition levels|5|
        |Progression order |RPCL|
        |Tile size |1024 x 1024|
        |Code block size| 64 x 64 (2<sup>6</sup> x 2<sup>6</sup>)|
        |Precinct size	|256 x 256 (2<sup>8</sup>) for 2 highest resolution levels; 128 x 128 (2<sup>7</sup>) for remaining resolution levels|
        |Number of quality layers|8|
        |Target compression ratio layers|2560:1 [1] ; 1280:1 [2] ;  640:1 [3] ; 320:1 [4] ; 160:1 [5] ; 80:1 [6] ; 40:1 [7] ; 20:1 [8]|
        |Error resilience|	Start-of-packet headers; end-of-packet headers; segmentation symbols|
        |Sampling rate|Stored in "Capture Resolution" fields|
        |Capture metadata|Embedded as XMP metadata in XML box|
        
        Note that jpylyzer is unable to establish the compression ratio of individual layers, so the access schema only checks for the overall compression ratio (i.e. 20:1). The more specific schemas (300Colour, 600Gray, etc.) contain additional checks for resolution values, the number of colour components and embedded ICC profiles. 
        
        ## Usage examples
        
        ### List available profiles
        
            jprofile d:\myBatch mybatch -p list
        
        This results in a list of all available profiles (these are stored in the installation folder's *profiles* directory):
        
            Available profiles:
            
            kb_600Gray_2014.xml
            kb_300Gray_2014.xml
            kb_300Colour_2014.xml
            kb_600Colour_2014.xml
            kb_generic_2014.xml
        
        
        ### Analyse batch
        
            jprofile d:\myBatch mybatch -p kb_300Colour_2014.xml
        
        This will result in the creation of 2 output files:
        
        - `mybatch_status.csv` (status output file)
        - `mybatch_failed.txt` (detailed output on images that failed quality asessment)
        
        ## Status output file
        
        This is a comma-separated file with the assessment status of each analysed image. The assessment status is either *pass* (passed all tests) or *fail* (failed one or more tests). Here's an example:
        
            F:\test\access\MMKB03_000004896_00015_access.jp2,pass
            F:\test\access\MMKB03_000004896_00115_access.jp2,pass
            F:\test\access\MMKB03_000004896_00215_access.jp2,pass
            F:\test\targets-jp2\MMKB03_MTF_RGB_20120626_02_01.jp2,fail
            F:\test\master\MMKB03_000004896_00015_master.jp2,pass
         
        
        ## Failure output file
        
        Any image that failed one or more tests are reported in the failure output file. For each failed image, it contains a full reference to the file path, followed by the specific errors. An example:
        
        
            F:\test\targets-jp2\MMKB03_MTF_RGB_20120626_02_01.jp2
            *** Schema validation errors:
            Test "layers = '11'" failed (wrong number of layers)
            Test "transformation = '5-3 reversible'" failed (wrong transformation)
            Test "comment = 'KB_MASTER_LOSSLESS_01/01/2015'" failed (wrong codestream comment string)
            ####
        
        Entries in this file are separated by a sequence of 4 '#' characters. Note that each line here corresponds to a failed test in the schema (this information is taken from *Probatron*'s output). For images that are identified as not-valid JP2 some additional information from *jpylyzer*'s output is included as well. For example:
        
        
            F:\test\master\MMUBL07_MTF_GRAY_20121213_01_05.jp2
            *** Schema validation errors:
            Test "isValidJP2 = 'True'" failed (no valid JP2)
            *** Jpylyzer JP2 validation errors:
            Test methIsValid failed
            Test precIsValid failed
            Test approxIsValid failed
            Test foundNextTilePartOrEOC failed
            Test foundEOCMarker failed
            ####
            
        
        Here, the outcome of test *isValidJP2* means that the image does not conform to the *JP2* specification. The lines following 'Jpylyzer JP2 validation errors' lists the specific errors that were reported by *jpylyzer*. The meaning of these errors can be found in the *jpylyzer* User Manual.
        
        ## Preconditions
        
        - All images that are to be analysed have a .jp2 extension (all others are ignored!)
        - *Master* images are located in a (subdirectory of a) directory called '*master*'
        - *Access* images are located in a (subdirectory of a) directory called '*access*'
        - *Target* images are located in a (subdirectory of a) directory called '*targets-jp2*'.
        - Either of the above directories may be missing.
        
        Other than that, the organisation of images may follow any arbitrary directory structure (*jprofile* does a recursive scan of whole directory tree of a batch)
        
        ## Known limitations
        
        - Images that have names containing square brackets ("[" and "]" are ignored (limitation of *Python*'s *glob* module, will be solved in the future).

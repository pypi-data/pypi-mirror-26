        ===========
        
        A distribution of yara specifically geared towards python use.  This project
        essentially wraps the regular yara in a specialized setup.py file which build
        libyara using the python distutils. The result is a python module with no
        special external dependencies - i.e. there is no dependency on the libyara dll.
        
        This project is also hosted on PyPi and distributes wheel packages for the
        common platforms meaning that python with yara support can be installed without
        local compilers.

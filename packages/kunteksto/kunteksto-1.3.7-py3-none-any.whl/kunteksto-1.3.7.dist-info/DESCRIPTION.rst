Kunteksto (ˈkänˌteksto) is a tool to help domain experts, data creators and data users translate their simple CSV formatted data files into the semantically enhanced formats that provide computable metadata. 
This provides a path for existing data to be used in conjuntion with the emerging *data-centric, model based* approach in analysis, general artificial intelligence and decision support systems. 
This approach opens the door for the change to a *data-centric* world as opposed to the *application-centric* one we have now. 
This new approach enables automatic interoperability avoiding the data quality issues created through data cleaning and massaging. The importance of this capability and improved data quality 
is discussed in foundational `S3Model <https://datainsights.tech/S3Model>`_ documentation and references. However, detailed understanding of S3Model is not required to understand and use 
the power of Kunteksto.

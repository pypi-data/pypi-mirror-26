        **A FTP-style client for HCP Anywhere File Sync & Share**
        
        HCP Anywhere is a File Sync & Share solution created and sold by Hitachi
        Data Systems. It offers a wide range of FS&S clients for Desktop computers,
        Mobile devices as well as Browsers.
        The lacking piece so far was a CLI client that allows to access HCP Anywhere
        on devices where no GUI is available (Linux servers, for example) or for
        scripting.
        
        **awftp** tries to fill this gap by providing a look and feel as close as
        possible to well-known CLI-based ftp clients. The features available
        are a subset of what is offered by ftp clients, due to the functionality the
        HCP Anywhere FS&S service offers through its API; some other functions in
        ftp clients simply doesn't make sense for use with HCP Anywhere. On the other
        hand, there are some features (*snap*, for example) not found with ftp...
        
        **Features**
        
            *   Navigate the folders stored in HCP Anywhere, including Mobilized NAS,
                Shared Folders, Team Folders, Backup Folders
            *   List folders content, including deleted files/folders
            *   Store, update and retrieve files
            *   Move files and folders
            *   Undelete files/folders
            *   Create/delete folders (even recursive)
            *   Link handling:
        
                *   Create links to share content with others - internal/public,
                    read-only, read-write, write-only
                *   List links
                *   Delete links
        
            *   Work with snapshots
            *   Restore files from snapshots
            *   Dynamically enables/disables features depending on the HCP Anywhere
                version connected to
            *   Authentication is Active Directory per default; if the HCP Anywhere is
                integrated a SAML IDP for authentication, the --saml parameter allows
                to select it for authentication
        
        
        
        Dependencies
        ------------
        
        You need to have at least Python 3.4.3 installed to run **awftp**.
        
        It uses Kenneth Reitz's famous
        `requests package <http://docs.python-requests.org/en/master/>`_
        for communication with HCP Anywhere. And it uses
        `click <http://click.pocoo.org/6/>`_ for text output, coloring and to show a
        progress bar.

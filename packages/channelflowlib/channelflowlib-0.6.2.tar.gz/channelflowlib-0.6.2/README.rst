ChannelFlowLib
===================

Python modules to use in solving hydraulic elements of an open channel. This uses the Manning's equation in solving the hydraulic elements.

This project aims to create bits of modules for hydraulics engineering and later to be combined as one package for easier distribution. It aims to create an open source software for this subject to help both engineering students and instructors if they ever find this useful to them.

There are four types of open channel classes in this module <u>openchannel</u>, _rectangular_, _trapezoidal_, _circular_ and for irregular sections as well.

Here are the checklist for this module:<br/>
- [x] Rectangular
- [x] Trapezoidal
- [x] Circular
- [x] Irregular Section

----

Notes:

- In the circular pipe class in the module open channel, I haven't incorporated yet the unit conversion. All units are assumed to be in metric. Although it's easy to incorporate it if you are to use it by subclassing it and override the getter and setter functions.
- Both circular and irregular section classes uses metric only. Feel free to override the getters and setters of those classes to apply unit conversions.
- Here are some assumptions/constraints in the IrregularSection class.
  * Only the left and right sides should be higher than water surface elevation.
  * Coefficient of roughness is uniform in the entire section.
  * Placement of points in the class constructor is properly sorted.

        Additional Python decorators implementing the descriptor interface.
        
        Use cases
        =========
        
        Like the built-in decorator, ``property``, these classes are initialized by and wrap a function, generally within the context of a class, in order to modify its behavior.
        
        cached property
        ---------------
        
        This decorator functions much like a read-only ``property``, with the difference that, upon access, it records its result in the instance's object data dictionary, which reference takes precedence in look-ups, thereby replacing itself for that object::
        
            from descriptors import cachedproperty
        
            @cachedproperty
            def circumference(self):
                return 2 * math.pi * self.radius
        
        class property
        --------------
        
        A read-only ``property`` for class methods::
        
            from descriptors import classproperty
        
            @classproperty
            def badpi(cls):
                return 22 / 7
        
        cached class property
        ---------------------
        
        A class ``property``, which caches its result in the data dictionary of the class from which it was invoked, (under another name, so as not to interfere with inheritance of the property)::
        
            from descriptors import cachedclassproperty
        
            @cachedclassproperty
            def badpi(cls):
                return 22 / 7
        
        Installation
        ============
        
        Dickens is a Python distribution, which may be installed via ``easy_install`` or ``pip``, *e.g.*::
        
            pip install Dickens
        
        ...or, from source::
        
            python setup.py install

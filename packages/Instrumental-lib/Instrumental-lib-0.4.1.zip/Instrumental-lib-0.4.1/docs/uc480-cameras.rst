UC480 (Thorlabs DCx) Cameras
============================

.. toctree::

This module is for controlling Thorlabs DCx cameras. You should install the
corresponding drivers that can be found on the Thorlabs website. Specifically,
this module requires either 'uc480.dll' or 'uc480_64.dll', depending on your
system. The driver library must be visible to python, so you may need to add it
to your PATH or copy it to your Windows system32 directory.

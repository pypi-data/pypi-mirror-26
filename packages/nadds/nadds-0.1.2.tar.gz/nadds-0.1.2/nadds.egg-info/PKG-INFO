Description-Content-Type: UNKNOWN
Description: Nadds is a library of Python extensions that complement the standard
        libraries in parts where full support for the UNIX API (or the Linux
        API) is missing.
        
        Most of the functions wrapped by Nadds are low-level, dirty, but
        absolutely necessary functions for real systems programming. These 
        functions are mostly added to mainstream Python3.
        
        Current list of features included:
        
        - recvmsg(2) and sendmsg(2), including use of cmsg(3)
        
        - socketpair(2)
        
        - support for TUN/TAP virtual network interfaces

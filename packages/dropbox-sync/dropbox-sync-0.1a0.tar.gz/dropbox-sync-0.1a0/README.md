RealTime sync for Dropbox folders

Many times you are using external resources such as a cluster or cloud machine, where you cannot install tools/softwares (e.g CHPC clusters don't allow me to install any additional tools myself". This is simple tool that syncs the required folder to Dropbox and downloads any changed files.

MOTIVATION:
    Many times I have run scripts on my personal machine but the computation power on my personal machine is limited. So I usually run the scripts on HPCs. After seeing the results you end up with chain of tweaks to the initial script. The script versions are different now on your personal machine and the cluster. So when you get to your personal machine you no longer have the latest copy. This tool solves this very problem.

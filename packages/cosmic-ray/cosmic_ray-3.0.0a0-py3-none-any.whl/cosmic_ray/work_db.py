# Database that keeps track of mutation testing work progress.
#
# Essentially, there's a row in the DB for each mutation that needs to be
# executed in some run. These initially start off with no results, and results
# are added as they're completed.
#
# What describes a work-item?
#  - module name
#  - operator name
#  - occurrence
#  - test runner name
#  - test args
#  - timeout
#
# What describes results?
#  - one of the strings 'exception', 'no-test', or 'normal'
#  - for 'exception', the sys.exc_info() of the exception
#  - for 'no-test', there are no other results
#  - for 'normal', there is an *activation-record* (a dict) and a
#    test_runner.TestResult.

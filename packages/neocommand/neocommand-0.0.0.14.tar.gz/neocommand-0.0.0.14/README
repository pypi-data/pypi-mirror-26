NeoCommand
==========

NᴇᴏCᴏᴍᴍᴀɴᴅ is an extension of Iɴᴛᴇʀᴍᴀᴋᴇ that provides manipulation of graph/network/tree data through the concept of Endpoints, through which Nodes, Edges, sub-graphs and arbitrary data are relayed.

This library primarily supports the Bɪᴏ42 application, which focuses on genomic data.

The user is therefore directed to the Bɪᴏ42 readme.

Please see the source code documentation itself for specific NᴇᴏCᴏᴍᴍᴀɴᴅ usage.

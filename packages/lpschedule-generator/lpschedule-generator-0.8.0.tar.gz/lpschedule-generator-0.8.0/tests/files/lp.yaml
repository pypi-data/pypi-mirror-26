            "Your workplace can exert a lot of control over how much
            free software you use, what you're allowed to work on in
            your own time and what kinds of tools you become an expert
            in. New employees don't always negotiate their contracts
            to make sure they can continue contributing to free
            software and current employees aren't always successful at
            advocating for using free software tools, choosing free
            software technologies or contributing changes back
            upstream when they do rely on free software. We'll address
            what's possible, what your legal department is likely to
            be concerned about and how to be a smooth negotiator at
            work. Many companies could benefit tremendously from using
            Free and Open Source Software, but free software
            enthusiasts and institutional gatekeepers are coming from
            very different perspectives.

            Free software developers and users tend to be most
            familiar with free software's benefits when compared to
            proprietary solutions; user freedom, reusing code, public
            code review for bugs, increased project capacity and
            cost. The uninitiated may -- unfortunately -- be most
            familiar with the risks, some real and some
            perceived. Employers also benefit from having workers who
            are passionate about their work, are well-connected to the
            free software community and are constantly learning about
            new technologies from their peers outside the company, but
            new employee contracts rarely recognize this unless you
            ask. Conversations about contracts, choosing new
            technologies and sharing an employee's work with another
            entity are high stakes negotiations. With a solid
            understanding of what worries and motivates the other
            parties, you can become a savvy advocate for free software
            at work."

            "Being a free software user isn't easy, especially when
            you're a college student. I spent a year at a school that
            taught Visual Basic as its primary programming language
            for freshmen and sophomores, where \"Introduction to
            Programming\" was an overview of the Windows OS, and where
            most of the professors would only accept papers typed in
            Times New Roman -- and I survived.

            In this session, I'll give students tips for making it
            through college while still adhering to the values we hold
            as free software users -- including alternative fonts,
            making a GNU/Linux live disk for use on public computers,
            avoiding the \"Netflix and Chill\" dilemma, and most
            importantly, ways to discuss free software with professors
            and fellow students. After leaving this session, students
            will feel empowered and able to hold their own as free
            users in a proprietary campus."

    CIA, NSA, and DIA for nearly a decade as a subject matter expert
    on technology and cybersecurity. In 2013, he revealed the NSA was

    individuals who had not been suspected of any wrongdoing,
    resulting in the largest debate about reforms to US surveillance
    policy since 1978. Today, he works on methods of enforcing human
    rights through the application and development of new
    technologies. He joined the board of Freedom of the Press
    Foundation in February 2014. <span class=\"text-muted\">Photo

    "Richard is a software developer and software freedom activist. In
    1983 he announced the project to develop the <a
    href=\"https://gnu.org\">GNU operating system</a>, a Unix-like
    operating system meant to be entirely free software, and has been
    the project's leader ever since. With that announcement Richard
    also launched the Free Software Movement. In October 1985 he
    started the Free Software Foundation.

    Since the mid-1990s, Richard has spent most of his time in
    political advocacy for free software, and spreading the ethical
    ideas of the movement, as well as campaigning against both
    software patents and dangerous extension of copyright laws. Before
    that, Richard developed a number of widely used software
    components of GNU, including the original Emacs, the GNU Compiler
    Collection, the GNU symbolic debugger (gdb), GNU Emacs, and
    various other programs for the GNU operating system."

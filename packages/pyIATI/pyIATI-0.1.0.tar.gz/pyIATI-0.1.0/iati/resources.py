"""A module to provide a way of locating resources within the IATI library.

There are two key groups of functions within this module: `get_*_path[s]()` and `load_as_*()`.

The `get_*_path[s](name)` functions provide information about where to locate particular types of resources with a provided name.

The `load_as_*(path)` functions load the contents of a file at the specified path and return it in the specified format.

Example:
    To load a test XML file located in `my_test_file` and use it to create a `Dataset`::

        dataset = iati.resources.load_as_dataset(iati.resources.get_test_data_path('my_test_file'))

Note:
    `pkg_resources` is used to allow resources to be located however the package is distributed. If using the standard `os` functionality, resources may not be locatable if, for example, the package is distributed as an egg.

Warning:
    Many of the constants in this module should be deemed private to the IATI library.

    The location of SSOT content may change. It may also require network access to perform certain tasks.

Todo:
    Determine how to distribute SSOT content - with package, or separately (being downloaded at runtime).

    Move the functions used to locate test data.

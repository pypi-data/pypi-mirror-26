================

This page briefly explains the way OAuth2 authentication with ADFS works.

.. code::

#. An unauthenticated user requests a protected page.
#. User gets redirected to ADFS.
#. ADFS authenticates the user.
#. ADFS redirected the user to a specific page and includes
   a authorization code in the query parameters
#. With the code Django requests an access token from ADFS
#. ADFS sends back an access token in JWT format including claims
#. Django validates the token and creates the user if it doesn't exists yet

Description: RPM Rebuild Helper
        ==================
        
        The RPM Rebuild Helper (or `rpmrh` for short)
        is an automation tool for rebuilding sets of (S)RPM files.
        Its main focus are `Software Collections <https://softwarecollections.org>`_.
        
        The tool allows the user to compare two sets of RPMs,
        download and modify the respective SRPMs locally
        and automatically rebuild them in a build service,
        among other things.
        
        Usage example
        -------------
        
        Compare released packages between two build services
        -- Fedora's Koji and CentOS CBS --
        for a `python34` software collection::
        
           rpmrh diff --from koji --to cbs --collection python34
        
        Or for all currently active (released and not End-of-Life) collections::
        
           rpmrh diff --all --from koji --to cbs
        
        Attempt to automatically rebuild all missing packages::
        
           rpmrh rebuild --from koji --to cbs --all

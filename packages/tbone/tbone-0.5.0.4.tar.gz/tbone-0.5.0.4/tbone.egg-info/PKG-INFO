        TBone makes it easy to develop full-duplex RESTful APIs on top of your
        ``asyncio`` web application or webservice. It uses a nonblocking
        asynchronous web server and provides the neccesary infrastructure to
        build asynchronous web apps and services. TBone is web-server agnostic
        and can be added on top of your ``Sanic`` or ``Aiohttp`` app.
        
        TBone is comprised of 4 major modules:
        
        1. Data Structure - an ODM-like modeling mechanism for schema
           declaration, data validation and serialization
        2. Data Persistency - Persistency mixin classes for document stores with
           a full implementation over MongoDB
        3. Resources - Mechanism for creating full-duplex RESTful APIs over
           ``HTTP`` and ``Websockets``
        4. Dispatch - Classes for managing internal and external events.
        
        Combining the usage of these 4 modules makes it extremely easy to build
        full-duplex RESTful APIs on top of your MongoDB datastore.
        
        Disclaimer
        ----------
        
        TBone is currently in Alpha stage. It may still have some bugs in the
        code, and some typos in the documentation. The APIs may change before an
        official release is made.
        
        Example
        -------
        
        The following example demonstrates the creation of a model schema and
        the corresponding RESTful resource
        
        .. code:: python
        
            class Book(Model, MongoCollectionMixin):
                _id = ObjecIdField(primary_key=True)
                title = StringField(required=True)
                author = StringField(required=True)
                publication_date = DateTimeField()
        
        
            class BookResource(AioHttpResource, MongoResource):
                class Meta:
                    object_class = Book
        
        Nonblocking
        -----------
        
        TBone was designed to develop asynchorous web applications and web
        services. The entire infrastructure was built around ``coroutines``.
        TBone utilizes only asynchronous 3rd party components to make sure that
        your app is truly nonblocking.
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        TBone uses the async/await syntax and is limited to Python version 3.5
        and up.
        
        Furthermore, TBone has some very few basic requirements. However,
        depending on its usage requires additional packages may be required.

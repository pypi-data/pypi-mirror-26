Description: django-file-picker
        ==================
        
        django-file-picker is a pluggable Django application used for uploading,
        browsing, and inserting various forms of media into HTML form fields.
        
        Using jQuery Tools, django-file-picker integrates seamlessly into pre-existing pages by
        installing an overlay that lists file details and, when applicable, image
        thumbnails. New files can also be uploaded from within the overlay (via AJAX
        Upload).
        
        django-file-picker provides a few optional extensions to help get started,
        including ``file_picker.uploads``, an app with pre-built Image and File models, and
        ``file_picker.wymeditor``, an app that integrates with
        `WYMeditor <http://www.wymeditor.org/>`_, a web-based
        WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean) XHTML editor. These extensions are
        provided for convenience and can easily be replaced by custom modules.

        Basic Installation
        ------------------
        
        #. Add ``file_picker`` to INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = (
                'file_picker',
                'file_picker.uploads', # file and image Django app
                'file_picker.wymeditor', # optional WYMeditor plugin
            )
        
           ``file_picker.uploads`` will automatically create two pickers named 'images' and 'files'.
        
        #. Add the ``file_picker`` URLs to urls.py, e.g.::
        
            from django.conf.urls import include, url
            import file_picker
        
            urlpatterns = [
                # ...
                url(r'^file-picker/', include(file_picker.site.urls)),
                # ...
            ]

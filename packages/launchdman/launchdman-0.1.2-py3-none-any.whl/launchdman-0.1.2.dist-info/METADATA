launchdman is a parser and manager for launchd, the service management framework used by macOS.
If you want to schedule to run certain tasks or programs, or run them in certain conditions, launcd is what you use on macOS.
launchdman lets you build your configurations and manage(add, remove, group, etc) them on the fly.

How to get help or report an issue ?
------------------------------------

.. There is no mailing list or forum actually, so you can either contact me or fill an issue on Github.

If you want to **discuss or ask questions on IntervalArithmetic**, you can subscribe and post messages on the
**IntervalArithmetic User** mailing list.

There is actually three lists running on Google Groups (*):

`User List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/IntervalArithmetic-user>`_
  List for IntervalArithmetic users
`Announce List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/IntervalArithmetic-announce>`_
  List for announcements regarding IntervalArithmetic releases and development
`Devel List <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/IntervalArithmetic-devel>`_
  List for developers of IntervalArithmetic

**If you encounter an issue, please fill an issue** on the `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/FabriceSalvaire/IntervalArithmetic/issues>`_.

(*) Despite Google Groups has many drawbacks, I don't have actually enough resources to run GNU Mailman or
Discourse on my own IT infrastructure.

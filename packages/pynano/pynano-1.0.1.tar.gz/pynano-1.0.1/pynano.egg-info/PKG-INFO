        `National Novel Writing Month <https://nanowrimo.org>`_ is an annual event in
        which the goal is generally to write 50,000 words of the first draft of a novel
        in the 30 days of November.
        
        Naturally, the hosts have graciously supplied a website with various means of
        updating and tracking one's progress through this adventure, including an `API
        <https://nanowrimo.org/wordcount_api>`_ to allow users to create their own
        progress trackers.
        
        This is where ``pynano`` comes into play, providing a simple, Pythonic way to
        acess this API and leverage its data in your own projects::
        
           >>> from pynano import User
           >>> kromey = User('kromey')
           >>> kromey.wordcount
           64133
           >>> kromey.name
           'Kromey'
        
        Objects are provided to access data about Users, Regions, and the Site itself;
        each also provides access to daily data to track progress through the month::
        
           >>> kromey.history[14].date # The sequence is 0-indexed, so index 14 is day 15
           '2015-11-15'
           >>> kromey.history[14].wordcount
           10499
        
        Requirements
        ------------
        
        ``pynano`` is supported on Python versions 2.7, 3.5, and 3.6, with these
        additional packages:
        
        * requests (version 2.9 or later)
        * xmltodict (version 0.9 or later)
        
        .. note::
        
           ``pynano`` is also tested against Python versions 3.3, and 3.4, though
           they are not officially supported. As a convenience, however, they remain
           listed on PyPi as long as they continue to pass tests.

Start on a tool based purely on regexp-specified rewrite of code lines for mutation generation, including
multi-language rules aided by special rules for languages or even projects.

Aim is partly to see how quickly mutation can be applied to new languages, partly how much work of a tool can be
offloaded to the compiler / test analysis tools.

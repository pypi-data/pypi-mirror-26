Description: 
                  'pauvre' is a package for plotting Oxford Nanopore and other long read data.
         The name means 'poor' in French, a play on words to the oft-used 'pore' prefix
         for similar packages. The current implementation of this package does the
         following things:
        
         1) marginplot - Makes marginal density plots for FASTQ files with Q scores.
         2) stats - Prints out helpful stats about your fastq file and a data table.
         3) synplot - Makes a synteny plot from gff files and protein alignments.
         4) redwood - makes a "genome browser" plot for circular genomes, like mitochondria.
        
         This package was designed for python 3, but it might work in
         python 2. You can visit the gitub page for more detailed information here:

"""
This module contains interplanetary trajectories problems in the form of PyGMO.problem classes. The use
of PyGMO.archipelago and PyGMO.island with these may result in slow execution as the parallel execution will
be handled by python multiprocessing module, which is far slower than boost::threads (used instead when the PyGMO problems
are implemented in c++)

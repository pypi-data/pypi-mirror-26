task-runner
===========

taskrunner runs your methods until they stop failing.

Motivation
----------

taskrunner is a crude way to force your methods to complete. This is
particularly useful when functions can be expected to throw exceptions
but shouldnâ€™t stop execution. Effectively, taskrunner catches all
exceptions and makes sure that the result is not in a list of excluded
return values.

Installation
------------

taskrunner is available via pip:

::

    $ pip install taskrunner

Usage
-----

.. code:: python

    from taskrunner import TaskRunner

    def some_function_that_may_throw(some_argument, another_argument):
        # Do something

    task_runner = TaskRunner()
    result = task_runner.run_until_complete(target=some_function_that_may_throw, args=('123','456'))
    print(result) # Hopefully something useful

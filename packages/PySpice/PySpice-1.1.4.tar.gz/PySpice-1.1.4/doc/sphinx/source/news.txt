V1.1.0
------

 * Enhanced shared mode
 * Shared mode is now set as default on Linux

V1.0.0
------

 * Bump version to v1.0.0 since it just works!
 * Support Windows platform using Ngspice shared mode
 * Fixed shared mode
 * Fixed and completed Spice parser : tested on example's libraries

V0.4.2
------

 * Fixed Spice parser for lower case device prefix.

V0.4.0
------

 * Git repository cleanup: filtered generated doc and useless files so as to shrink the repository size.
 * Improved documentation generator: Implemented :code:`format` for RST content and Tikz figure.
 * Improved unit support: It implements now the International System of Units.
   And we can now use unit helper like :code:`u_mV` or compute the value of :code:`1.2@u_kÎ© / 2@u_mA`.
   The relevant documentation is on this `page <api/PySpice/Unit.html>`_.
 * Added the Simulation instance to the Analysis class.
 * Refactored simulation parameters as classes.

V0.3.2
------

 * fixed CCCS and CCVS

V0.3.1
------

 * fixed ngspice shared

V0.3.0
------

 * Added an example to show how to use the NgSpice Shared Simulation Mode.
 * Completed the Spice netlist parser and added examples, we could now use a schematic editor
   to define the circuit.  The program *cir2py* translates a circuit file to Python.

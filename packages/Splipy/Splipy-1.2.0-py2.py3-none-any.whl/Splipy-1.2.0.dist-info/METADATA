This repository contains the Splipy packages. Splipy is a pure python library for the creation, evaluation and manipulation of B-spline and NURBS geometries. It supports n-variate splines of any dimension, but emphasis is made on the use of curves, surfaces and volumes. The library is designed primarily for analysis use, and therefore allows fine-grained control over many aspects which is not possible to achieve with conventional CAD tools.

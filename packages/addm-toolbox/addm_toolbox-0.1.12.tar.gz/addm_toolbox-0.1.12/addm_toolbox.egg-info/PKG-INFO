Description: aDDM Toolbox
        ============
        
        This toolbox can be used to perform model fitting and to generate
        simulations for the attentional drift-diffusion model (aDDM), as well as
        for the classic version of the drift-diffusion model (DDM) without an
        attentional component.
        
        Prerequisites
        -------------
        
        aDDM-Toolbox supports Python 2.7 (and Python 3.6 tentatively -- please
        report any bugs). The following libraries are required:
        
        -  deap
        -  future
        -  matplotlib
        -  numpy
        -  pandas
        -  scipy
        
        Installing
        ----------
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install addm_toolbox
        
        Running tests
        -------------
        
        To make sure everything is working correctly after installation, try
        (from a UNIX shell, not the Python interpreter):
        
        ::
        
            $ addm_toolbox_tests
        
        This should take a while to finish, so maybe go get a cup of tea :)
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        To get a feel for how the algorithm works, try:
        
        ::
        
            $ addm_demo --display-figures
        
        You can see all the arguments available for the demo using:
        
        ::
        
            $ addm_demo --help
        
        Here is a list of useful scripts which can be similarly run from a UNIX
        shell:
        
        -  addm\_demo
        -  ddm\_pta\_test
        -  addm\_pta\_test
        -  addm\_pta\_mle
        -  addm\_pta\_map
        -  addm\_simulate\_true\_distributions
        -  addm\_basinhopping
        -  addm\_genetic\_algorithm
        -  ddm\_mla
        -  addm\_mla
        
        You can also have a look directly at the code in the following modules:
        
        -  addm.py contains the aDDM implementation, with functions to generate
           model simulations and obtain the likelihood for a given data trial.
        -  ddm.py is equivalent to addm.py but for the DDM.
        -  addm\_pta\_test.py generates an artificial data set for a given set
           of aDDM parameters and attempts to recover these parameters through
           maximum a posteriori estimation.
        -  ddm\_pta\_test.py is equivalent to addm\_pta\_test.py but for the
           DDM.
        -  addm\_pta\_mle.py fits the aDDM to a data set by performing maximum
           likelihood estimation.
        -  addm\_pta\_map.py performs model comparison for the aDDM by obtaining
           a posterior distribution over a set of models.
        -  simulate\_addm\_true\_distributions.py generates aDDM simulations
           using empirical data for the fixations.
        
        Common issues
        -------------
        
        If you get errors while using the toolbox under Python 3, try it with
        Python 2.7.
        
        If you get a Python RuntimeError with the message "Python is not
        installed as a framework.", try creating the
        fileÂ ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc and adding the following code:
        
        ::
        
            backend: TkAgg

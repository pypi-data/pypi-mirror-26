"""
Represents a job or a node's "shape", in terms of the dimensions of memory, cores, disk and
wall-time allocation.

The wallTime attribute stores the number of seconds of a node allocation, e.g. 3600 for AWS,
or 60 for Azure. FIXME: and for jobs?

The memory and disk attributes store the number of bytes required by a job (or provided by a
node) in RAM or on disk (SSD or HDD), respectively.

        man
        ===
        
        ``man`` is a software distribution tool that works over setuptools and
        help integerate PyPi, Travis, Github and You together. This lets you
        create a python library and have it deployed in less than ten minutes.
        
        Getting started
        ---------------
        
        Creation
        ~~~~~~~~
        
        Say that you have an idea of a new library that you would like to share
        with other on PyPi. You know python, you use github and you don't want
        to spend hours struggling in the mess of package distribution.
        
        Thus, just install ``man``:
        
        ::
        
            pip install man 
        
        NOTE: If you are on windows, you will need to install ``pyreadline``
        with ``pip install pyreadline``.
        
        And create a new library:
        
        ::
        
            man new-lib
        
        Then answer the short questions about your library:
        
        ::
        
            Name of your library:
            Short description:
            Keywords (space separated): 
            Full name:
            E-Mail:
            Github username:
            PyPi username:
        
        If you don't already have a PyPi account, you need to `create
        one <https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=register_form>`__.
        
        Then you will be prompted for your github password to create a new
        repository with the name of your lib.
        
        Then you just need to: - Setup Travis: - `create an
        account <https://travis-ci.org/>`__ - Find your repo at
        https://travis-ci.org/profile/YOURNAME and turn the switch on. - Add
        your travis password to the .travis.yml: - Open ``bash`` - And just run
        ``travis encrypt --add deploy.password`` - And type your travis password
        - Add classifiers (or tags) for your library so people can find it more
        easily, run ``man add tag`` - Write your code, do commits, tests and
        whatever you want. - Complete the readme.md (not the readme.rst, because
        it is always converted from the readme.md.)
        
        First release
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        Now the version of your code is ``0.0.0``. I choose to use the simple
        ``MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`` system as it's easy to use, understand and work
        with.
        
        When you are ready for your first release, type
        
        ::
        
            man release major
        
        Enter a description of your first release (it can be more than one line)
        and confirm that you want to create a new release. Your code is then
        taged with ``v1.0.0``, and that will trigger a Travis build and
        deployment on PyPi. You can go on
        `travis-ci.org <https://travis-ci.org/>`__\ and when everything is
        finished, type:
        
        ::
        
            pip install my-new-lib
        
        And that's it!
        
        And after
        ~~~~~~~~~
        
        Then, everytime you add functionalities or correct bugs and you want to
        share them just type one of the following:
        
        ::
        
            man release patch  # When you just fix broken things
            man release minor  # when you add functionnality
            man release major  # when you do big changes (maybe not backward compatible)
        
        All commands are well described, so try to run them with the ``--help``
        flag to see what ``man`` can do.
        
        List of commands:
        -----------------
        
        Id there is a tilde (``~``) after a command, there is an interactive
        prompt disponible, with autocompletion.
        
        ``man`` - ``add`` - ``keywords [KW1] [KW2] ...`` -
        ``package [PATH_TO_PKG]`` - ``dependancy [LIBRARY] [VERSION]`` ~ -
        ``script`` ~ - ``tag`` ~ - ``remove`` - ``keywords`` ~ -
        ``package [PKG_NAME]`` ~ - ``dependancy [LIBRARY]`` ~ -
        ``script [NAME]`` ~ - ``tag`` ~ - ``release [major|minor|patch]`` -
        ``--test`` - ``--again`` - ``new [DESTINATION_DIR]`` ~ - ``changelog`` -
        ``-v`` / ``--verbose`` - ``config`` ~ - See the ``pyconfiglib``
        `reference <https://github.com/ddorn/pyconfiglib>`__. - ``gen`` -
        ``readme.rst`` - ``setup.py`` - ``MANIFEST.in``

        Create playlists democratically by reactions in Slack
        
        !! THIS IS STILL A BETA !!
        
        * Documentation: https://slacksound.readthedocs.org/en/latest
        
        Features
        --------
        * Get Youtube videos reactions from message attachments and add the song to a Spotify playlist.
        
        
        How does it work
        ----------------
        The application acts as a middle man between Slack and Spotify by getting the
        reactions count from a message's attachment and then looking up the title on
        Spotify's. If the title has been found, it will add the one that has best
        popularity to the queue.
        
        In order to the bot pick up the song, a user must paste a Youtube URL in the
        channel. The bot will start looking for reactions on that URL and get the title
        of the video which it will be used as a search text for Spotify.
        
        A message will be shown back to the channel whether the bot could add the song
        to the playlist or not.
        
        It is worth mention that the tracks of the playlist will be removed at every
        time the bot it is started. This is by design as it in a jukebox.

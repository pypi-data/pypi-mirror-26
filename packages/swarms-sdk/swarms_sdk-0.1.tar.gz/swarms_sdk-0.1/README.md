Swarms API Python SDK
=====================

This repo contains a Python software development kit to interface with the Swarms' API, as well as examples of use.

Get started
-----------

This has been tested with Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 (should work with other 3.x versions too).

To get started, install the package with `pip install swarms_sdk` or include `swarms_sdk` in your `requirements.txt` file.

Look at the examples in `swarms/create.py`, `swarms/retrieve.py`, and `swarms/delete.py`!

Development
-----------

1. Copy `swarms/config.py.template` to `swarms/config.py`:
    ```
    cp swarms/config.py{.template,}
    ```
2. Put your credentials in `swarms/config.py`. To get credentials, you currently need to shoot us an email: `info@swarms.tech`

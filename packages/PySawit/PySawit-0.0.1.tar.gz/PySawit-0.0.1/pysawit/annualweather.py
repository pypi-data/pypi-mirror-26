class AnnualWeather(object):
    """
    Hold one year weather data in an ordered dictionary (`table` attribute).

    This class is meant to be inherited, so that the update method can be implemented to
    fill in, either by simulation or reading in data from a file, the table with one year of
    weather data. The annual weather data is stored in the attribute table.

    Weather data consist of weather parameters/fields and data sets, where weather
    parameters are names such as 'rain' (for rainfall), 'tmin' (for min. air temperature), 'tmax'
    (for max. air temperature), 'wind' (for wind speed), and so on. The names of these weather
    parameters are provided by users.

    These weather parameters make up one data set. If these data sets represent daily weather
    data, then one year of weather data would have 365 data sets. But this is not necassarily
    always the case. A data set may represent hourly weather data. If this is the case, the
    annual weather data would then have: 365 days/year x 24 hours/day = 8,760 data sets.

    By overriding the `__call__()` method, objects of this class can be called like this:

    ```python
       obj('wind')
    ```

    to retrive the whole year of wind speed data, or

    ```python
        obj('wind')[30]
    ```

    will retrieve the wind speed from the 30th data set. If each data set is daily weather data,
    then this will retrieve the wind speed data for the 30th day.

    And by overriding the `__str__()` method, the entire annual weather data can be printed as a
    formatted output. For instance:

    ```python
        print(obj)
    ```

    prints the entire annual weather data, where every line of output contains each data set.

    # ATTRIBUTES
        nsets (int): Number of data sets that make up a year
        fields (list): List of weather parameters/fields for each data set
        table (OrderedDict): Hold the annual weather data

    # METHODS
        update: Fill in the table attribute with annual weather data. Needs to be implemented
                by the descendant class.

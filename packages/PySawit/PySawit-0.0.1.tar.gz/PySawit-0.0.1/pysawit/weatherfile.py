    """
    Weather file class to read and parse weather data from a given weather file.

    Given a weather file (comma-delimited and plain text file format), this class loads the file,
    reads, then parses the file content for the weather data. The weather data is then stored in a
    dictionary instance attribute named `data`.

    The weather file (in this case, we will name the file "weather.txt") must follow the
    following format (in plain text file):

    ```text
        # lines starting with hash (#) are comments (comments are optional)
        # sample weather data in "weather.txt"
        *doy,sunhr,tmax,tmin,rh,wind,rain
        1,5.95,31.4,22,87,1.04,0
        2,5.1,32.7,21.9,96,1.02,0
        ...
        364,5.5,31.7,20.5,95,0.73,0.4
        365,8.05,32,20.6,96,0.58,0
    ```

    where the data are separated by commas. The first two rows of the file begins with the `#`
    character, which denotes these two lines are comments. You can have as many comment lines in
    a weather file as you like, so long as you start the line for each comment with `#`. Comments
    are ignored by this class. Note: comments, if any, must only appear at the beginning of the
    file. However, you cannot have comments within the weather data or at the end of the file.

    After the comment lines, you will list down the weather data, where the data are separated
    commas. The third line in the "weather.txt" above contains the column headers, where "doy" is
    the day of year, "sunhr" is the sunshine hours, "tmax" and "tmin" are the maximum and minimum
    air temperature, respectively, "wind" is the wind speed, and "rain" is the rainfall amount.

    Column headers are mandatory because they indicate what kind of data are being stored.
    Header names are user-defined and need not follow the example in "weather.txt". For example,
    you can have column headers named "year", "month", and "day" to indicate the year,
    month, and day, respectively. You can even use "rainfall" as the header for rain, instead of
    "rain", as used in the "weather.txt" file example. Please note that header names are
    case-sensitive, so column headers "rain", "Rain", and "RAIN" are not the same to one another.

    Note the symbol `*` in front of "doy" column header in "weather.txt". This symbol `*`
    indicates that "doy" is the key used to search for weather data. So, if we want to search for
    the weather data when the day of year is 2 (doy==2), this class will return
    "5.1,32.7,21.9,96,1.02,0" (see the fifth row in "weather.txt" above).

    This class will read the file from top to bottom, so once we reached the end of the weather
    data, the class will 'rewind' so that data search begins again from the top. So, after
    searching the weather data for doy==365, and if the data have been exhausted, the next call to
    search for the weather data for doy==1 will return "5.95,31.4,22,87,1.04,0" (see fourth row in
    "weather.txt" above).

    You can have as many keys as you want, so long as you precede the column headers with `*`.
    In this example, we have created three keys:

    ```text
        # "weather2.txt"
        *year,*month,*day,doy,sunhr,tmax,tmin,rh,wind,rain
        1990,1,1,1,5.95,31.4,22,87,1.04,0
        1990,1,2,2,5.1,32.7,21.9,96,1.02,0
        ...
    ```

    so that "year", "month", and "day" are keys that will be used to search for the weather data.
    Keys do not need to be consecutively arranged or even begin the header line. For instance,

    ```text
        # "weather3.txt"
        sunhr,*doy,tmax,tmin,rh,wind,rain,*year
        5.95,1,31.4,22,87,1.04,0,1990
        5.1,2, 32.7,21.9,96,1.02,0,1990
        ...
    ```

    where you now have two keys ("doy" and "year'), and these keys are not arranged consecutively
    and do not start the header line.

    Lastly, the weather data need not be for 1 year. You can place two or more years' worth of
    weather, such as:

    ```text
        # "weather4.txt"
        *doy,sunhr,tmax,tmin,rh,wind,rain
        1,5.95,31.4,22,87,1.04,0
        2,5.1,32.7,21.9,96,1.02,0
        ...
        364,5.5,31.7,20.5,95,0.73,0.4
        365,8.05,32,20.6,96,0.58,0
        1,2.1,31.4,22.1,100,0.75,1.3
        2,4.15,31.9,22.1,91,0.74,50.6
        ...
        1,5,31.1,19.9,91,0.64,3.6
        2,3,31.5,20.2,96,0.71,32.7
        ...
    ```

    Again, as mentioned earlier, if the weather data set have been exhausted, the class will
    'rewind' the search back from the start. This is useful when you want to reuse the same
    weather data set repeatedly in simulation runs (e.g., running a 20-year simulation time
    with only one year of weather data set).

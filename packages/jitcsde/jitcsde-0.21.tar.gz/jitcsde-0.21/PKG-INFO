Description: JiTCSDE stands for just-in-time compilation for stochastic differential equations (SDEs).
        It makes use of the method described by Rackauckas and Nie.
        JiTCSDE is designed in analogy to `JiTCODE <http://github.com/neurophysik/jitcode>`_:
        It takes an iterable (or generator function) of `SymPy <http://www.sympy.org/>`_ expressions, translates them to C code, compiles them (and an integrator wrapped around them) on the fly, and allows you to operate this integrator from Python.
        If you want to integrate ordinary or delay differential equations, check out
        `JiTCODE <http://github.com/neurophysik/jitcode>`_, or
        `JiTCDDE <http://github.com/neurophysik/jitcdde>`_, respectively.
        
        Note that this is work in progress; features and names may change without warning.

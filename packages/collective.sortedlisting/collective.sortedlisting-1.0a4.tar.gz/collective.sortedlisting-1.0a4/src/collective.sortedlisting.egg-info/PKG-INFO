        ==============================
        
        Plone Collection type is a very flexible way to aggregate
        content from your site. It supports querying the catalog
        together with sorting the results according to an
        sortable index (modified date, title, etc.).
        
        Sometimes you need a customized sorting of the results.
        Think of a folder with many person content items in it
        and you want to display it with sorting A
        in one place of your site and with sorting B
        in another place of a site.
        
        This is where this addon steps in. It allows to
        sort the results of a collection query on the
        collection/listing itself. It is done by the editor.
        
        
        Features
        --------
        
        If you install a package it will provide a custom
        contenttype (SortableCollection) which has the same
        features as the standard Collection type and additionally
        allows the sorting of the results in the preview section
        with drag&drop.
        
        The contenttype makes use of a behavior (SortableCollection)
        which can be used by custom contenttypes.
        
        If you have Mosaic installed the addon provides the
        *Sortable Contentlisting* tile which inherits from
        the Contentlisting tile from plone.app.standardtiles
        with the additional sorting features.

class Moonshot(

    """
    Base class for Moonshot strategies.

    To create a strategy, subclass this class. Implement your trading logic in the class
    methods, and store your strategy parameters as class attributes.

    Class attributes include built-in Moonshot parameters which you can override, as well
    as your own custom parameters.

    To run a backtest, at minimum you must implement `get_signals`, but in general you will
    want to implement the following methods (which are called in the order shown):

        `get_signals` -> `allocate_weights` -> `simulate_positions` -> `simulate_gross_returns`

    To trade (i.e. generate orders intended to be placed, but actually placed by other services
    than Moonshot), you must also implement `create_orders`. Order generation for trading
    follows the path shown below:

        `get_signals` -> `allocate_weights` -> `create_orders`

    Parameters
    ----------
    CODE : str, required
        the strategy code

    DB : str, required
        code of history db to pull data from

    DB_FIELDS : list of str, optional
        fields to retrieve from history db (defaults to ["Open", "High", "Low",
        "Close", "Volume"])

    CONIDS : list of int, optional
        limit history db query to these conids

    UNIVERSES : list of str, optional
        limit history db query to these universes

    EXCLUDE_CONIDS : list of int, optional
        exclude these conids from history db query

    EXCLUDE_UNIVERSES : list of str, optional
        exclude these universes from history db query

    CONT_FUT : str, optional
        pass this cont_fut option to history db query (default None)

    LOOKBACK_WINDOW : int, optional
        get this much additional data prior to the backtest start date or trade date
        to account for rolling windows (default 0)

    MASTER_FIELDS : list of str, optional
        get these fields from the securities master service (defaults to ["Currency",
        "MinTick", "Multiplier", "PriceMagnifier", "PrimaryExchange", "SecType", "Symbol",
        "Timezone"])

    NLV : dict, optional
        dict of currency:NLV for each currency represented in the strategy. Can
        alternatively be passed directly to backtest method.

    COMMISSION_CLASS : Class or dict of (sectype,exchange,currency):Class, optional
        the commission class to use. If strategy includes a mix of security types,
        exchanges, or currencies, you can pass a dict mapping tuples of
        (sectype,exchange,currency) to the different commission classes. By default
        no commission is applied.

    SLIPPAGE_CLASSES : iterable of slippage classes
        one or more slippage classes. By default no slippage is applied.

    SLIPPAGE_BPS : float, optional
        amount on one-slippage to apply to each trade in BPS (for example, enter 5 to deduct
        5 BPS)

    BENCHMARK : int, optional
        the conid of a security in the historical data to use as the benchmark

    Examples
    --------
    Example of a minimal strategy that runs on a history db called "mexi-stk" and buys when
    the securities are above their 200-day moving average:

    def allocate_weights(self, signals, prices):

        Return a DataFrame of weights based on the signals.

        Whereas signals indicate the direction of the trades, weights
        indicate both the direction and size. For example, -0.5 means a short
        position equal to 50% of the equity allocated to the strategy.

        Weights are used to help create orders in live trading, and to help
        simulate executed positions in backtests.

        The default implemention of this method evenly divides allocated
        capital among the signals each period, but it is intended to be
        overridden by strategy subclasses.

        A variety of built-in weight allocation algorithms are provided by

        weights were allocated. Intended to be overridden by strategy

        Typically you'll run backtests via the QuantRocket client and won't
        call this method directly.

        Parameters
        ----------
        start_date : str (YYYY-MM-DD), optional
            the backtest start date (default is to include all history in db)

        end_date : str (YYYY-MM-DD), optional
            the backtest end date (default is to include all history in db)

        nlv : dict
            dict of currency:nlv. Should contain a currency:nlv pair for
            each currency represented in the strategy

        allocation : float
            how much to allocate to the strategy

        Returns
        -------

            multiindex (Field, Date) DataFrame of backtest results

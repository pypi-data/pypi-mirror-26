Brutal Maze
===========

Brutal Maze is a hash and slash game with fast-paced action and a minimalist
art style.

The game features a trigon trapped in an infinite maze. As our hero tries to
escape, the maze's border turn into aggressive squares trying to stop him. Your
job is to help the trigon fight against those evil squares and find a way out
(if there is any). Be aware that the more get killed, the more will show up and
our hero will get weaker when wounded.

Being a research game, Brutal Maze has a few primary goals:

* Highly portable.
* Auto-generated and infinite maze.
* No binary data for drawing.
* Enemies with randomized attributes: stun, poison, camo, etc.
* Somewhat a realistic physic and logic system.
* Resizable game window in-game.

Brutal Maze is written in Python and is compatible with both version 2 and 3.

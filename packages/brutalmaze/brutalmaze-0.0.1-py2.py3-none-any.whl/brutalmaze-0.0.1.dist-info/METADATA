Brutal Maze
===========

Brutal Maze is a research hash and slash game with fast-paced action and a
minimalist art style.

The game features a trigon trapped in an infinite maze. As our hero tries to
escape, the maze's border turn into aggressive squares trying to stop him. Your
job is to help the trigon fight against those evil squares and find a way out
(if there is any). Be aware that the more get killed, the more will show up and
our hero will get weaker when wounded.

As a research game, Brutal Maze has a few primary goals:

* Highly portable.
* Auto-generated and infinite maze.
* No binary art data.
* Enemies with randomized attributes: stun, poison, etc.
* Resizable in realtime.

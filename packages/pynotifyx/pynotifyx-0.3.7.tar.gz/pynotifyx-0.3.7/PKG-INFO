Description: 
        pynotifyx is a simple Python binding to the Linux inotify file system event
        monitoring API.
        
        Documentation is provided in the module.  To get help, start an interactive
        Python session and type:
        
        >>> import pynotifyx
        >>> help(pynotifyx)
        
        You can also test out pynotifyx easily.  The following command will print events
        for /tmp:
        
          python -m pynotifyx /tmp
        
        Tests can be run via setup.py:
        
          ./setup.py test
        
        Note that the module must be built and installed for tests to run correctly.
        In the future, this requirement will be lifted.

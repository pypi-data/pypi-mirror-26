        ## Installing
        
        [Installation Guide](http://chaudio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installing.html)
        
        It is available on pypi, so run ``pip3 install chaudio``.
        
        Python3 is the officially supported language, but an effort is made to be compatable with python2, so you can try ``pip install chaudio``. Please open an [issue](https://github.com/chemicaldevelopment/chaudio/issues) if either of these fails.
        
        
        ### From Source
        
        Clone this repo, and then run ``python3 setup.py install`` (or ``python setup.py install``)

        ## Usage
        
        [Getting Started Guide](http://chaudio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html)
        
        
        ### Examples
        
        Located in `examples/`, multiple example use cases of chaudio are shown.
        
        To run with the development version of chaudio, prepend the PYTHONPATH environment.
        
        `PYTHONPATH=$PWD python3 examples/{FILE}`
        
        Or, if chaudio is installed, just run:
        
        `python3 examples/{FILE}`
        
        
        #### examples/simple.py
        
        This creates a WAV file (`simple.wav`) that contains 5 seconds of the note A4 as a sin waveform.
        
        
        #### examples/addnoise.py
        
        This takes an input, and an optional output (default is `addnoise.wav`). 
        
        It reads in a file, adds static, then outputs the result to output.
        
        Run like `python3 examples/addnoise.py simple.wav -o simple_static.wav` (assuming you've ran `examples/simple.py`).
        
        
        #### examples/arrange.py
        
        This example shows how to create an entire song, efficiently and rubustly. The result is `arranged.wav`
        
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        You need either version of python (2 and 3 work, 3 is recommended), as well as numpy, scipy, and simpleaudio.
        
        You can easily install with pip: 
        
        either `pip install chaudio`, or, for python3, `pip3 install chaudio`

Description: # chaudio
        
        chaudio is a collection of audio processing tools
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Examples
        
        Located in `examples/`, multiple example use cases of chaudio are shown.
        
        To run with the development version of chaudio, prepend the PYTHONPATH environment.
        
        `PYTHONPATH=$PWD python3 examples/{FILE}`
        
        Or, if chaudio is installed, just run:
        
        `python3 examples/{FILE}`
        
        #### examples/simple.py
        
        This creates a WAV file (`simple.wav`) that contains 5 seconds of the note A4 as a sin waveform.
        
        #### examples/addnoise.py
        
        This takes an input, and an optional output (default is `addnoise.wav`). 
        
        It reads in a file, adds static, then outputs the result to output.
        
        Run like `python3 examples/addnoise.py simple.wav -o simple_static.wav` (assuming you've ran `examples/simple.py`).
        
        
        #### examples/compose.py
        
        This example shows how to create an entire song, efficiently and rubustly.
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        You need `python3`, and will need numpy, matplotlib, and other dependencies.
        
        Just run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all python dependencies.

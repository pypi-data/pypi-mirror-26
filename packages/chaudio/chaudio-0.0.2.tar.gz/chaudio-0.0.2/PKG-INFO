Description: # chaudio
        
        chaudio is a python module to programmatically create music.
        
        chaudio contains audio processing utilities for converting audio, and applying effects to already generated songs
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### Examples
        
        Located in `examples/`, multiple example use cases of chaudio are shown.
        
        To run with the development version of chaudio, prepend the PYTHONPATH environment.
        
        `PYTHONPATH=$PWD python3 examples/{FILE}`
        
        Or, if chaudio is installed, just run:
        
        `python3 examples/{FILE}`
        
        
        #### examples/simple.py
        
        This creates a WAV file (`simple.wav`) that contains 5 seconds of the note A4 as a sin waveform.
        
        
        #### examples/addnoise.py
        
        This takes an input, and an optional output (default is `addnoise.wav`). 
        
        It reads in a file, adds static, then outputs the result to output.
        
        Run like `python3 examples/addnoise.py simple.wav -o simple_static.wav` (assuming you've ran `examples/simple.py`).
        
        
        #### examples/compose.py
        
        This example shows how to create an entire song, efficiently and rubustly.
        
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        You need either version of python (2 and 3 work, 3 is recommended), as well as numpy, scipy, and matplotlib.
        
        You can easily install with pip: 
        
        either `pip install chaudio`, or, for python3, `pip3 install chaudio`

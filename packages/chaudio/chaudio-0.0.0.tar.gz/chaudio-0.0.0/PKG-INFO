Description: # chaudio
        
        chaudio is a collection of audio processing tools
        
        
        ## Usage
        
        ### ex_simple.py
        
        Run `python3 src/ex_simple.py` to create `simple.wav`, and showcase basis synthesis with chaudio
        
        
        ### ex_read.py
        
        This allows you to perform analysis on existing sound files
        
        Run `python3 src/ex_read.py -h` for help.
        
        Once you've ran `ex_simple.py`, you will have `simple.wav`, which you can use with this example:
        
        `python3 src/ex_read.py simple.wav -g freq`
        
        to show a frequency graph of the sound
        
        
        ### ex_waveform.py
        
        Use this to test out various waveforms:
        
        `python3 src/ex_waveform.py -w "wf.saw(t, hz, 0.78)" -g`
        
        the `-w` option refers to the wave generation. Complete this with `t`, `hz` and then an (optional) tweak value
        
        
        ### ex_compose.py
        
        This is more in depth, how to use arrangers to string together notes, and use plugins
        
        
        ## Installation
        
        You need `python3`, and will need numpy, matplotlib, and other dependencies.
        
        Just run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all python dependencies.

      <h3 class="text-muted">Magen "Hello, World" Application, aka "HWA"</h3>
    </div>

    <p>
      A simple demonstration application that uses the Magen services
      (identity, policy, ingestion, key). A more extensive overview is
      provided at "What's going on here?".
    </p>

    <p>
      The application, through a browser interface, maintains a toy filesystem
      on its local Linux instance that stores ingested assets (files)
      in an encrypted format. Attempts to view the assets are checked
      against the Magen policy server. When using the application, you are an
      "ordinary user", uploading, viewing, and deleting files. A more
      extensive overview is provided at "Using HWA".
    </p>

    <p>
      An additional role is the policy administrator. (Absent any
      policies, all attempts to view assets will fail.) Policy
      administration is done via postman. Two policy-specific postman
      collections are included with the policy code for this purpose. A
      more extensive overview is provided at "Policy Administration".

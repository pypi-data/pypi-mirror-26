    <p>
      Magen is a set of services (policy, identity, ingestion, key
      management) that provide context-sensitive policy enforcement
      and asset encryption with key managementkey management.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magen could be deployed in the cloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      Magen is structured as a set of modular microservices that are
      designed to integrate with existing infrastructure. For
      instance:
      <ul>
	<li>
	  The identity service does not manage identities parallel
	  to whatever identity management an organzation is already using.
	  Instead, the intent instead is to connect the
	  identity service to an existing source of identity
	  (Salesforce or an LDAP installation, for example) and use
	  existing identities for policy contracts and policy evaluation.
	</li>
	<li>
	  The policy service, aside from connecting to identity, is
	  intended to connect to other policy information providers,
	  e.g. Cisco ISE, to provide device and location information.
	</li>
	<li>
	  In various deployments, only a subset of the services may be
	  appropriate.
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      For the sample application, imagine an organization with HWA, a
      toy repository, and a very simple identity facilty: a single
      user with no password.
    <p>
      The HWA toy repository, is a simplified example of an application
      for Magen. By integrating with Magen, HWA gets policy
      enforcement, asset encryption, and key management.

    <p>
      For HWA, Magen policies are administered using <b>postman</b> with
      pre-defined requests.
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
	In your cloned git workspace are various postman subdirectories,
	including one under the policy server directory.
      </li>
      <li>
	The policy server postman directory contains a collections for
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    policy generic operations (e.g. get-all-contracts) and for
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    policy demo requests (e.g. create-contract-for-hwa).
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	The policy demo collection request(s) that include "hwa" in the
	description are intended to demonstrate how HWA repository
	accesses for viewing are affected by policy.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      <b>Scope</b> of policies under HWA
      <ul>
	<li>
	  viewing and download of decrypted assets is subject to policy
	</li>
	<li>
	  viewing and download of encrypted assets is not subject to policy
	</li>
	<li>
	  ingestion is not subject to policy
	</li>
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
      The demonstration <b>script</b>, from a clean systems, is as follows.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	From postman, establish the postman environment for policy
	administration:
	<ol type="a">
	  <li>
	    Import the policy generic collection
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Import the poicy demo collection
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Set the "local" environment.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    From the policy generic collection, select and send the
	    GET request to get all sessions.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Examine the returned list, which should have be empty.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>
	From HWA, log in (as the pre-defined user): neither ingestion
	nor viewing may proceed without logging in.
      <li>
	From postman, verify that a "policy session" has been established.
	<ol type="a">
	  <li>
	    From the policy generic collection, select and send the
	    GET request to get all sessions.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Examine the returned list, which should have be empty.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>
	From HWA ingestion menu, ingest an item.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    This should succeed, as it is not subject to policy.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	From HWA repository view, attempt to view the previously ingested item.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    This should fail, as no policy allowing the access has
	    been established.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
      <li>
	From postman, install the hwa policy contract that allows access
	by the pre-defined user.
	<ol type="a">
	  <li>
	    From the policy generic collection, select and send the GET request
	    to get all contracts and examine the returned list, which
	    should be empty.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    From the policy demo collection, select and send the POST request
	    that installs the contract.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    From the policy generic collection, select and send the GET request
	    to get all contracts.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Examine the returned list, which should have a single
	    element, the contract just installed.
	  </li>
	</ol>
      </li>
      <li>
	From HWA repository view, attempt to view the previously ingested item.
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    This should succeed, as a policy allowing the access has been
	    established.
	  </li>
	</ul>
      </li>
    </ol>

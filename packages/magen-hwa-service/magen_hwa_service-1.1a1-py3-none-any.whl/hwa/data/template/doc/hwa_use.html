    </div>

    <pp>
      The application, through a browser interface, maintains a toy
      repository (on a filesystem on its local Linux instance).
    </pp>

    <pp>
      The following screens are supported
    </pp>

      <dl>
	<dt>Login</dt>
	<dd>
          Login to HWA app.
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      Required before any HWA filesystem operations.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      Underneath, HWA update the magen id service with a "client",
	      which is available to other magen services, e.g. policy.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      In HWA, login is a dummy operation with a hard-coded user.
	    </li>
	    <li>
	      The login is preserved in a Flask session for a period
	      of time (PERMANENT_SESSION_LIFETIME, e.g. 10 minutes),
	      after which point the login button must be clicked again.
	      [As a point of information, Flask exports a browser
	      session cookie, so the login is preserved across an
	      HWA restart.]
	</dd>
	<dt>Repository</dt>
	<dd>
	  Show assets (files) currently ingested into Magen.
	  For each asset, various operations may be performed.
	  <dl>
	    <dt>View</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Preview an asset, by decrypting the stored
	      file (notes.txt.html) back to the original contents.
	      <ul>
		<li>
		  The policy service (ps) checks if a policy allows this
		  access. (No policy is currently applied to ingestion.)
		  Policy "contracts" may be managed through policy's http
		  APIs as driven by postman requests. Collections of useful
		  policy http requests are found in policy's postman
		  directory.
		</li>
		<li>
		  The identity service provides information (username, device,
		  etc) that is checked against policies.
		</li>
	      </ul>
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Download</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Similar to View but downloads the asset rather than
	      previewing it.
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Raw-View</dt>
	    <dd>
	      For educational purposes, display the html container
              (e.g. notes.txt.html) for the encrypted asset, i.e. show a
              one-line message that the actual contents can only be
              accessed through a magen viewer operation to the encrypted
              file (notes.txt.html)
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Raw-Download</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Similar to Raw-View but downloads the asset rather than
	      previewing it, to allow inspection of the container
	      format
	    </dd>
	    <dt>Delete</dt>
	    <dd>
	      Clean up entries on the HWA toy repository
	    </dd>
	  </dl>
	</dd>
	<dt>Ingestion</dt>
	<dd>
	  Upload a file (notes.txt), e.g. from laptop running
          browser, encrypt, and store in Magen container format
          (notes.txt.html)
	  <ul>
	    <li>
	      The ingestion service produces the containerized format
	      and assigns a magen assetId to it.
	    </li>
            <li>
	      The key service stores a key for the asset, indexed by
              assetId
	    </li>
	  </ul>
	</dd>
      </dl>

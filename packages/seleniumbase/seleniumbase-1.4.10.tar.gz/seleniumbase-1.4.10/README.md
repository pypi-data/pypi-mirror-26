# SeleniumBase

<b>All-in-One Test Automation Framework</b>

SeleniumBase makes it easy to run WebDriver automation with [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) and [nosetests](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).

<a id="main_introduction"></a>
### ![http://seleniumbase.com](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/super_logo_tiny.png "SeleniumBase") Intro and Demo

<b>Simple [Python](https://www.python.org/) syntax makes coding easy:</b><br>

![](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/SampleCode2.png "SeleniumBase Python Code")
<br>(<i>By default, [CSS Selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) are used for finding page elements.</i>)

<b>Customize scripts from the command line:</b>
```bash
nosetests my_first_test.py --demo_mode --with-selenium --browser=chrome -s

pytest my_first_test.py --demo_mode -s
```
<b>Watch [my_first_test.py](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/examples/my_first_test.py) run in [Demo Mode](#seleniumbase_demo_mode):</b>

![](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/sb_demo.gif "SeleniumBase Demo")

<b>No more flaky tests:</b><br>
SeleniumBase automatically waits for page elements to finish loading before interacting with them (*up to a timeout limit*). This means you no longer need random ``time.sleep()`` statements in your code.

<b>SeleniumBase helps keep your code clean:</b><br>
This long line of WebDriver code...
```python
self.driver.find_element_by_css_selector("textarea").send_keys("text")
```
...becomes the following in SeleniumBase:
```python
self.update_text("textarea", "text")
```
You can still use ``self.driver`` in your code.

<b>Business Mindset</b>:<br>
SeleniumBase makes it easy to automate tedious business tasks. (*To learn about businesses using SeleniumBase, [Click Here](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/happy_customers.md).*)

<b>Hybrid Automation</b>:<br>
SeleniumBase includes an automated/manual hybrid solution called **[MasterQA](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/seleniumbase/masterqa/ReadMe.md)**, which speeds up manual testing by having automation perform all the web browser actions while the manual tester only needs to validate what is seen. **[Learn more about it here.](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/seleniumbase/masterqa/ReadMe.md)**

<a id="dependency_installation"></a>
### ![http://seleniumbase.com](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/super_logo_tiny.png "SeleniumBase") **Setup Instructions for Mac, Ubuntu, and Windows**

*(**Debian Linux users**: Run [Linuxfile.sh](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/integrations/linux/Linuxfile.sh) to setup your Debian Linux machine.)*

*(**Docker users**: See the [Docker ReadMe](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/integrations/docker/ReadMe.md) to setup your Docker machine.)*


#### **Step 0a:** Setup your [![Python version](https://img.shields.io/badge/python-2.7,_3.*-22AADD.svg "Python version")](https://docs.python.org/2/) Python/pip environment:

* To install ``python``, ``pip``, ``git``, and either ``virtualenv`` or ``virtualenvwrapper``, **[follow these instructions](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/requirements_installation.md)**.


#### **Step 0b:** Install web browsers to run automation on:

* Download & install web browsers such as [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/index.html) (or [Chromium](https://download-chromium.appspot.com/)) and [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/firefox/new/).


#### **Step 0c:** Get web drivers for each browser you intend to run automation on:

To run automation on various web browsers, you'll need to download a driver file for each one and place it on your System **[PATH](http://java.com/en/download/help/path.xml)**. On a Mac, ``/usr/local/bin`` is a good spot. On Windows, make sure you set the System Path under Environment Variables to include the location where you placed the driver files:

* For Chrome, get [Chromedriver](https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/downloads) on your System Path. (**Version 2.32 or above is recommended!**)

* For Firefox, get [Geckodriver](https://github.com/mozilla/geckodriver/releases) on your System Path.

* For Microsoft Edge, get [Edge Driver (Microsoft WebDriver)](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/tools/webdriver/) on your System Path.

* For Safari, get [Safari Driver](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/using_safari_driver.md) on your System Path.

* For PhantomJS headless browser automation, get [PhantomJS](http://phantomjs.org/download.html) on your System Path.

(NOTE: For older versions of Firefox such as 46.0 and earlier, you don't need Geckodriver. The older driver comes prepackaged with Selenium.)

(NOTE: If you don't have access rights to update system variables, you can use the [Anaconda Version of Python 2](https://www.continuum.io/downloads). In that case, place web drivers in ``Anaconda_Installation_Path/Scripts/``)

Mac:

* On a Mac, you can install drivers more easily by using ``brew`` (aka ``homebrew``), but you have to install that first. [Brew installation instructions are here](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/requirements_installation.md).

```bash
brew install chromedriver phantomjs
```

(NOTE: If your existing version of chromedriver is less than 2.32, **upgrading is recommended!**)

```bash
brew upgrade chromedriver
```

* To verify that the web drivers are working, **[follow these instructions](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/verify_webdriver.md)**.


<a id="seleniumbase_installation"></a>
### ![http://seleniumbase.com](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/super_logo_tiny.png "SeleniumBase") **Step 1:** Clone SeleniumBase

```bash
git clone https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase.git
cd SeleniumBase
```

(A Git GUI tool like [SourceTree](http://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) may make things easier.)


### **Step 2:** Create a Virtual Environment

If you're not sure how to create one, **[follow these instructions](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/virtualenv_instructions.md)**.<br>For an overview of virtual environments and why it's good practice to use them, see **[http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/](http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/)**.


### **Step 3:** Install SeleniumBase

To install SeleniumBase from the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/seleniumbase) use:
```bash
pip install seleniumbase --upgrade
```

To install your local customized version of SeleniumBase use:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt --upgrade

python setup.py install
```

(NOTE: If you're using Python 3.* instead of Python 2.7, use ``pip3`` in place of ``pip`` and ``python3`` in place of ``python`` in the above commands.)


<a id="seleniumbase_basic_usage"></a>
### ![http://seleniumbase.com](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/super_logo_tiny.png "SeleniumBase") **Step 4:** Run the Example Script

**Here's what the example script looks like:**

```python
from seleniumbase import BaseCase

class MyTestClass(BaseCase):

    def test_basic(self):
        self.open('http://xkcd.com/353/')            # Navigate to the web page
        self.assert_element('img[alt="Python"]')       # Assert element on page
        self.click('a[rel="license"]')                  # Click element on page
        self.assert_text('copy and reuse', 'div center')  # Assert element text
        self.open('http://xkcd.com/1481/')
        image_object = self.find_element('#comic img')    # Returns the element
        caption = image_object.get_attribute('title')   # Get element attribute
        self.assertTrue('connections to the server' in caption)
        self.click_link_text('Blag')              # Click on link with the text
        self.assert_text('xkcd', '#site-title')
        header_text = self.get_text('header h2')  # Grab text from page element
        self.assertTrue('The blag of the webcomic' in header_text)
        self.update_text('input#s', 'Robots!\n')  # Fill in field with the text
        self.assert_text('Hooray robots!', '#content')
        self.open('http://xkcd.com/1319/')
        self.assert_text('Automation', 'div#ctitle')
```

**Here's how to run the example script on various web browsers by using nosetests:**

(NOTE: You can interchange **nosetests** with **pytest** [as seen here](#pytest_basic_usage).)

```bash
cd examples/

nosetests my_first_test.py --with-selenium --browser=chrome -s

nosetests my_first_test.py --with-selenium --browser=firefox -s

nosetests my_first_test.py --with-selenium --browser=phantomjs -s
```

After the test completes, in the console output you'll see a dot (``.``) on a new line, representing a passing test. (On test failures you'll see an ``F`` instead, and on test errors you'll see an ``E``). It looks more like a moving progress bar when you're running a ton of unit tests side by side. This is part of nosetests. After all tests complete (in this case there is only one), you'll see the "``Ran 1 test in ...``" line, followed by an "``OK``" if all nosetests passed. The ``--with-selenium`` option is required for running GUI tests with nosetests (not needed when using pytest). If no browser is specified, Chrome will become the default. The ``-s`` option is optional, and that makes sure that any standard output is printed immediately on the command line when tests have print statements in them, which makes debugging much easier.

(NOTE: If you're confused about how SeleniumBase works with Nosetests and Pytest, jump to the [**How SeleniumBase Works**](#how_seleniumbase_works) section to learn more about it.)

<a id="seleniumbase_demo_mode"></a>
If the example test is moving too fast for your eyes to see what's going on, you can run it in **Demo Mode** by adding ``--demo_mode`` on the command line, which pauses the browser briefly between actions, and highlights page elements being acted on:

```bash
nosetests my_first_test.py --with-selenium --browser=chrome -s --demo_mode
```

You can override the default wait time by either updating [settings.py](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/seleniumbase/config/settings.py) or by using ``--demo_sleep={NUM}`` when using Demo Mode. (NOTE: If you use ``--demo_sleep={NUM}`` without using ``--demo_mode``, nothing will happen.)

If you ever make any changes to your local copy of ``settings.py``, you may need to run ``python setup.py install`` for those changes to take effect.

```bash
nosetests my_first_test.py --with-selenium --browser=chrome -s --demo_mode --demo_sleep=1.2
```

You can also add either of the following to your scripts to slow down the tests:

```python
import time; time.sleep(5)  # sleep for 5 seconds (add this after the line you want to pause on)
import ipdb; ipdb.set_trace()  # waits for your command. n = next line of current method, c = continue, s = step / next executed line (will jump)
```

(NOTE: If you're using pytest instead of nosetests and you want to use ipdb in your script for debugging purposes, you'll either need to add "--capture=no" on the command line, or use "import pytest; pytest.set_trace()" instead of using ipdb. More info on that [here](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2678792/can-i-debug-with-python-debugger-when-using-py-test-somehow).)

You may also want to have your test sleep in other situations where you need to have your test wait for something. If you know what you're waiting for, you should be specific by using a command that waits for something specific to happen.

If you need to debug things on the fly (in case of errors), use this line to run the code:

```bash
nosetests my_first_test.py --browser=chrome --with-selenium --pdb --pdb-failures -s
```

The above code (with --pdb) will leave your browser window open in case there's a failure, which is possible if the web pages from the example change the data that's displayed on the page. (ipdb commands: 'c', 's', 'n' => continue, step, next).

Here are some other useful nosetest arguments that you may want to append to your run commands:

```bash
--logging-level=INFO  # Hide DEBUG messages, which can be overwhelming.
-x  # Stop running the tests after the first failure is reached.
-v  # Prints the full test name rather than a dot for each test.
--with-id  # If -v is also used, will number the tests for easy counting.
```


<a id="pytest_basic_usage"></a>
Here's how to run the example script with **pytest**:

```bash
cd examples/

pytest my_first_test.py --with-testing_base --browser=firefox -s

pytest my_first_test.py --with-testing_base --browser=chrome -s

pytest my_first_test.py --with-testing_base --browser=phantomjs -s
```
(NOTE: The ``--with-testing_base`` plugin gives you full logging on test failures, which saves screenshots, page source, and basic test info into the logs folder.)

(NOTE: If you're using **pytest** instead of nosetests for running tests outside of the SeleniumBase repo, **you'll need a copy of [pytest.ini](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/pytest.ini) at the base of the new folder structure.**


<a id="how_seleniumbase_works"></a>
### ![http://seleniumbase.com](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/super_logo_tiny.png "SeleniumBase") **How SeleniumBase Works:**

At the core, SeleniumBase works by extending Nosetests and Pytest as a direct plugin to each one. This plugin is activated by using "``--with-selenium``" as a command line argument when running Nosetest/Pytest. When activated, Selenium-WebDriver automatically spins up web browsers for tests, and then gives those tests access to the SeleniumBase libraries through the base class.

Once you've activated the main SeleniumBase plugin with "``--with-selenium``", you can use "``--browser=chrome``" to specify the web browser to use (Default = "Chrome"). You can also include additional plugins for additional features such as "``--with-testing_base``" (for logging data/screenshots on test failures) and "``--demo_mode``" (for highlighting elements & slowing test runs). There are also other plugins available such as "``--with-db_reporting``", "``--with-s3_logging``", and more.

(NOTE: Nosetests and Pytest work by automatically running any Python method that starts with "``test``" from the file that you specified on the command line. You can also run all tests from a specific class in a file, or even pick out an individual test to run.)

To use SeleniumBase calls you need the following:
```python
from seleniumbase import BaseCase
```
And then have your test classes inherit BaseCase:
```python
class MyTestClass(BaseCase):
```
(*See the example test, [my_first_test.py](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/examples/my_first_test.py), for reference.*)


<a id="creating_visual_reports"></a>
### ![http://seleniumbase.com](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/super_logo_tiny.png "SeleniumBase") **Creating Visual Test Suite Reports:**

(NOTE: The command line args are different for Nosetests vs Pytest)

#### **Nosetest Reports:**

The ``--report`` option gives you a fancy report after your test suite completes. (Requires ``--with-testing_base`` to also be set when ``--report`` is used because it's part of that plugin.)

```bash
nosetests my_test_suite.py --with-selenium --with-testing_base --report --browser=chrome -s
```
![](http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/Test_Report_2.png "Example Nosetest Report")

(NOTE: You can add ``--show_report`` to immediately display the report after the test suite completes. You don't want to use this when running tests remotely because otherwise the test run will hang indefinitely until someone manually exits the report.)

#### **Pytest Reports:**

Using ``--html=report.html`` gives you a fancy report of the name specified after your test suite completes.

```bash
pytest my_test_suite.py --with-selenium --html=report.html
```

<a id="utilizing_advanced_features"></a>
### ![http://seleniumbase.com](https://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/100006/images/super_logo_tiny.png "SeleniumBase") **Using Production Environments & Integrations:**

Here are some things you can do to setup a production environment for your testing:

* You can setup a [Jenkins](http://jenkins-ci.org/) build server for running tests at regular intervals. (Or you can use any build server you want.)

* You can use [Selenium Grid](https://github.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/wiki/Grid2) to scale your testing by distributing tests on several machines with parallel execution. To do this, just spin up some remote machines with WebDriver installed, then update the *.cfg file that lives with your tests on your build server to point there. When doing so, add the command line option to use that file like this: ``--config=[MY_CONFIG_FILE].cfg``). An example config file called selenium_server_config_example.cfg has been provided for you in the integrations/selenium_grid folder. The start-selenium-node.bat and start-selenium-server.sh files are for running your grid. In an example situation, your Selenium Grid server might live on a unix box and your Selenium Grid nodes might live on EC2 Windows virtual machines. When your build server runs a Selenium test, it would connect to your Selenium Grid to find out which Grid browser nodes are available to run that test. To simplify things, you can use [Browser Stack](https://www.browserstack.com/automate) as your entire Selenium Grid (and let them do all the fun work of maintaining the grid for you).

* There are ways of running your tests from Jenkins without having to utilize a remote machine. One way is by using PhantomJS as your browser (it runs headlessly). Another way is by using Xvfb (another headless system). [There's a plugin for Xvfb in Jenkins](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Xvfb+Plugin). If you have Xvfb running in the background, you can add ``--headless`` to your run command in order to utilize it. For information about the Xvfb plugin for Jenkins, [click here](http://qxf2.com/blog/xvfb-plugin-for-jenkins-selenium/). To see a real-world Jenkins example of headless browser automation in action, [check out the SeleniumBase Google Cloud ReadMe](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/integrations/google_cloud/ReadMe.md), which covers this topic with screenshots.

* If you're using the [SeleniumBase MySQL feature](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/help_docs/mysql_installation.md) to save results from tests running on a server machine, you can install [MySQL Workbench](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/tools/workbench/) to help you read & write from your DB more easily.

* If you're using AWS, you can setup an [Amazon S3](http://aws.amazon.com/s3/) account for saving your log files and screenshots for future viewing. SeleniumBase already has all the code you need to connect to it. (You'll need to modify [settings.py](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/seleniumbase/config/settings.py) with connection details to your instance and the location in S3 where you want log files to be saved.)

* If you use [Slack](https://slack.com), you can easily have your Jenkins jobs display results there by using the [Jenkins Slack Plugin](https://github.com/jenkinsci/slack-plugin). Another way to send messages from your tests to Slack is by using [Slack's Incoming Webhooks API](https://api.slack.com/incoming-webhooks).

* If you use [HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/), you can easily have your Jenkins jobs display results there by using the [Jenkins HipChat Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/HipChat+Plugin). Another way is by using the [hipchat_reporting plugin](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/seleniumbase/plugins/hipchat_reporting_plugin.py) (nosetests only).

* Be sure to tell SeleniumBase to use these added features when you set them up. That's easy to do. You would be running tests like this:

```bash
nosetests [YOUR_TEST_FILE].py --browser=chrome --with-selenium --with-testing_base --with-db_reporting --with-s3_logging -s
```
(NOTE: If you haven't configured your MySQL or S3 connections in [settings.py](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/seleniumbase/config/settings.py), don't use ``--with-db_reporting`` or ``--with-s3_logging``.)

When the testing_base plugin is used, if there's a test failure, the basic_test_info plugin records test logs, the page_source plugin records the page source of the last web page seen by the test, and the screen_shots plugin records the image of the last page seen by the test where the failure occurred. Make sure you always include testing_base whenever you include a plugin that logs test data. The db_reporting plugin records the status of all tests run into your MySQL DB. The s3_logging plugin uploads basic test info, screenshots, and page source into your S3 storage folder.

To simplify that long run command, you can create a *.cfg file, such as the one provided in the example, and enter your plugins there so that you can run everything by typing:

```bash
nosetests [YOUR_TEST_FILE].py --config=[MY_CONFIG_FILE].cfg -s
```

You can simplify that even more by using a setup.cfg file, such as the one provided for you in the examples folder. If you kick off a test run from within the folder that setup.cfg is location in, that file will automatically be used as your configuration, meaning that you wouldn't have to type out all the plugins that you want to use (or include a config file) everytime you run tests.

If you tell nosetests to run an entire file, it will run every method in that python file that starts with "test". You can be more specific on what to run by doing something like:

```bash
nosetests [YOUR_TEST_FILE].py:[SOME_CLASS_NAME].test_[SOME_TEST_NAME] --config=[MY_CONFIG_FILE].cfg -s
```

Let's try an example of a test that fails. Copy the following into a file called fail_test.py:
```python
""" test_fail.py """
from seleniumbase import BaseCase

class MyTestClass(BaseCase):

    def test_find_army_of_robots_on_xkcd_desert_island(self):
        self.open("http://xkcd.com/731/")
        self.assert_element("div#ARMY_OF_ROBOTS", timeout=3)  # This should fail
```
Now run it:

```bash
nosetests test_fail.py --browser=chrome --with-selenium --with-testing_base -s
```

You'll notice that a logs folder, "latest_logs", was created to hold information about the failing test, and screenshots. Take a look at what you get. Remember, this data can be saved in your MySQL DB and in S3 if you include the necessary plugins in your run command (and if you set up the neccessary connections properly). For future test runs, past test results will get stored in the archived_logs folder if you have ARCHIVE_EXISTING_LOGS set to True in [settings.py](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/seleniumbase/config/settings.py).

self.refresh_page()  # This method reloads the current page.

self.get_current_url()  # This method returns the current page URL.

self.get_page_source()  # This method returns the current page source.
```

**ProTip™:** You may need to use the get_page_source() method along with Python's find() command to parse through the source to find something that Selenium wouldn't be able to. (You may want to brush up on your Python programming skills for that.)
Ex:
```python
source = self.get_page_source()
first_image_open_tag = source.find('<img>')
first_image_close_tag = source.find'</img>', first_image_open_tag)
everything_inside_first_image_tags = source[first_image_open_tag+len('<img>'):first_image_close_tag]
```

#### Clicking

To click an element on the page:

```python
self.click("div#my_id")
```

**ProTip™:** In most web browsers, you can right-click on a page and select ``Inspect Element`` to see the CSS selector details that you'll need to create your own scripts.

#### Typing Text

self.update_text(selector, text)  # updates the text from the specified element with the specified value. An exception is raised if the element is missing or if the text field is not editable. Example:

```python
self.update_text("input#id_value", "2012")
```

You can also use self.add_text() or the WebDriver .send_keys() command, but those won't clear the text box first if there's already text inside.
If you want to type in special keys, that's easy too. Here's an example:

```python
from selenium.webdriver.common.keys import Keys
self.find_element("textarea").send_keys(Keys.SPACE + Keys.BACK_SPACE + '\n')  # the backspace should cancel out the space, leaving you with the newline
```

#### Getting the text from an element on a page

```python
text = self.get_text("header h2")
```

#### Getting the attribute value from an element on a page

```python
attribute = self.get_attribute("#comic img", "title")
```

#### Asserting existance of an element on a page within some number of seconds:

```python
self.wait_for_element_present("div.my_class", timeout=10)
```
(NOTE: You can also use: ``self.assert_element_present(ELEMENT)``)

#### Asserting visibility of an element on a page within some number of seconds:

```python
self.wait_for_element_visible("a.my_class", timeout=5)
```
(NOTE: The short versions of this are ``self.find_element(ELEMENT)`` and ``self.assert_element(ELEMENT)``. The find_element() version returns the element)

Since the line above returns the element, you can combine that with .click() as shown below:

```python
self.find_element("a.my_class", timeout=5).click()

# But you're better off using the following statement, which does the same thing:

self.click("a.my_class")  # DO IT THIS WAY!
```

**ProTip™:** You can use dots to signify class names (Ex: ``div.class_name``) as a simplified version of ``div[class="class_name"]`` within a CSS selector. 

You can also use ``*=`` to search for any partial value in a CSS selector as shown below:

```python
self.click('a[name*="partial_name"]')
```

#### Asserting visibility of text inside an element on a page within some number of seconds:

```python
self.wait_for_text_visible("Make it so!", "div#trek div.picard div.quotes", timeout=3)
self.wait_for_text_visible("Tea. Earl Grey. Hot.", "div#trek div.picard div.quotes", timeout=1)
```
(NOTE: The short versions of this are ``self.find_text(TEXT, ELEMENT)`` and ``self.assert_text(TEXT, ELEMENT)``)

#### Asserting Anything

```python
self.assertTrue(myvar1 == something)

self.assertEqual(var1, var2)
```

#### Useful Conditional Statements (with creative examples in action)

is_element_visible(selector)  # is an element visible on a page
```python
import logging
if self.is_element_visible('div#warning'):
    logging.debug("Red Alert: Something bad might be happening!")
```

is_element_present(selector)  # is an element present on a page
```python
if self.is_element_present('div#top_secret img.tracking_cookie'):
    self.contact_cookie_monster()  # Not a real method unless you define it somewhere
else:
    current_url = self.get_current_url()
    self.contact_the_nsa(url=current_url, message="Dark Zone Found")  # Not a real method unless you define it somewhere
```
Another example:
```python
def is_there_a_cloaked_klingon_ship_on_this_page():
    if self.is_element_present("div.ships div.klingon"):
        return not self.is_element_visible("div.ships div.klingon")
    return False
```

is_text_visible(text, selector)  # is text visible on a page
```python
def get_mirror_universe_captain_picard_superbowl_ad(superbowl_year):
    selector = "div.superbowl_%s div.commercials div.transcript div.picard" % superbowl_year
    if self.is_text_visible("For the Love of Marketing and Earl Grey Tea!", selector):
        return "Picard HubSpot Superbowl Ad 2015"
    elif self.is_text_visible("Delivery Drones... Engage", selector):
        return "Picard Amazon Superbowl Ad 2015"
    elif self.is_text_visible("Bing it on Screen!", selector):
        return "Picard Microsoft Superbowl Ad 2015"
    elif self.is_text_visible("OK Glass, Make it So!", selector):
        return "Picard Google Superbowl Ad 2015"
    elif self.is_text_visible("Number One, I've Never Seen Anything Like It.", selector):
        return "Picard Tesla Superbowl Ad 2015"
    elif self.is_text_visible("""With the first link, the chain is forged.
                              The first speech censored, the first thought forbidden,
                              the first freedom denied, chains us all irrevocably.""", selector):
        return "Picard Wikimedia Superbowl Ad 2015"
    elif self.is_text_visible("Let us make sure history never forgets the name ... Facebook", selector):
        return "Picard Facebook Superbowl Ad 2015"
    else:
        raise Exception("Reports of my assimilation are greatly exaggerated.")
```

#### Switching Tabs

What if your test opens up a new tab/window and now you have more than one page? No problem. You need to specify which one you currently want Selenium to use. Switching between tabs/windows is easy:
Ex:

```python
self.switch_to_window(1)  # this switches to the new tab (0 is the first one)
```

**ProTip™:** iFrames follow the same principle as new windows - you need to specify the iFrame if you want to take action on something in there
Ex:

```python
self.switch_to_frame('ContentManagerTextBody_ifr')
# Now you can act inside the iFrame
# .... Do something cool (here)
self.switch_to_default_content()  # exit the iFrame when you're done
```

#### Handle Pop-Up Alerts

What if your test makes an alert pop up in your browser? No problem. You need to switch to it and either accept it or dismiss it:
Ex:

```python
self.wait_for_and_accept_alert()

self.wait_for_and_dismiss_alert()
```

If you're not sure whether there's an alert before trying to accept or dismiss it, one way to handle that is to wrap your alert-handling code in a try/except block. Other methods such as .text and .send_keys() will also work with alerts.

#### Executing Custom jQuery Scripts:

jQuery is a powerful JavaScript library that allows you to perform advanced actions in a web browser.
If the web page you're on already has jQuery loaded, you can start executing jQuery scripts immediately.
You'd know this because the web page would contain something like the following in the HTML:

```html
<script src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1/jquery.min.js"></script>
```

It's OK if you want to use jQuery on a page that doesn't have it loaded yet. To do so, run the following command first:

```python
self.activate_jquery()
```

Here are some examples of using jQuery in your scripts:
```python
self.execute_script('jQuery, window.scrollTo(0, 600)')  # Scrolling the page

self.execute_script("jQuery('#annoying-widget').hide()")  # Hiding elements on a page

self.execute_script("jQuery('#annoying-button a').remove()")  # Removing elements on a page

self.execute_script("jQuery('%s').mouseover()" % (mouse_over_item))  # Mouse-over elements on a page

self.execute_script("jQuery('input#the_id').val('my_text')")  # Fast text input on a page

self.execute_script("jQuery('div#dropdown a.link').click()")  # Click elements on a page

self.execute_script("return jQuery('div#amazing')[0].text")  # Returns the css "text" of the element given

self.execute_script("return jQuery('textarea')[2].value")  # Returns the css "value" of the 3rd textarea element on the page
```

In the following example, javascript is used to plant code on a page that Selenium can then touch after that:
```python
self.open(SOME_PAGE_TO_PLAY_WITH)
referral_link = '<a class="analytics test" href="%s">Free-Referral Button!</a>' % DESTINATION_URL
self.execute_script("document.body.innerHTML = \"%s\"" % referral_link)
self.click("a.analytics")  # Clicks the generated button
```

#### Using non-terminating verifications:

Let's say you want to verify multiple different elements on a web page in a single test, but you don't want the test to fail until you verified several elements at once so that you don't have to rerun the test to find more missing elements on the same page. That's where page checks come in. Here's the example:

```python
from seleniumbase import BaseCase

class MyTestClass(BaseCase):

    def test_non_terminating_checks(self):
        self.open('http://xkcd.com/993/')
        self.wait_for_element('#comic')
        self.check_assert_element('img[alt="Brand Identity"]')
        self.check_assert_element('img[alt="Rocket Ship"]')  # Will Fail
        self.check_assert_element('#comicmap')
        self.check_assert_text('Fake Item', '#middleContainer')  # Will Fail
        self.check_assert_text('Random', '#middleContainer')
        self.check_assert_element('a[name="Super Fake !!!"]')  # Will Fail
        self.process_checks()
```

``check_assert_element()`` and ``check_assert_text()`` will save any exceptions that would be raised.
To flush out all the failed checks into a single exception, make sure to call ``self.process_checks()`` at the end of your test method. If your test hits multiple pages, you can call ``self.process_checks()`` at the end of all your checks for a single page. This way, the screenshot from your log file will make the location where the checks were made.

#### Accessing raw WebDriver

If you need access to any commands that come with standard WebDriver, you can call them directly like this:
```python
self.driver.delete_all_cookies()
capabilities = self.driver.capabilities
self.driver.find_elements_by_partial_link_text("GitHub")
```
(In general, you'll want to use the SeleniumBase versions of methods when available.)

####  Checking Email: 
Let's say you have a test that sends an email, and now you want to check that the email was received:

```python
from seleniumbase.fixtures.email_manager import EmailManager, EmailException
num_email_results = 0
email_subject = "This is the subject to search for (maybe include a timestamp)"
email_manager = EmailManager("[YOUR SELENIUM GMAIL EMAIL ADDRESS]")  # the password for this is elsewhere (in the library) because this is a default email account
try:
    html_text = email_manager.search(SUBJECT="%s" % email_subject, timeout=300)
    num_email_results = len(html_text)
except EmailException:
    num_email_results = 0
self.assertTrue(num_email_results)  # true if not zero
```

Now you can parse through the email if you're looking for specific text or want to navigate to a link listed there.


####  Database Powers: 
Let's say you have a test that needs to access the database. First make sure you already have a table ready. Then try this example:

```python
from seleniumbase.core.mysql import DatabaseManager
def write_data_to_db(self, theId, theValue, theUrl):
    db = DatabaseManager()
    query = """INSERT INTO myTable(theId,theValue,theUrl)
               VALUES (%(theId)s,%(theValue)s,%(theUrl)s)"""
    db.execute_query_and_close(query, {"theId":theId,
                               "theValue":theValue,
                               "theUrl":theUrl})
```

Access credentials are stored in [settings.py](https://github.com/seleniumbase/SeleniumBase/blob/master/seleniumbase/config/settings.py) for your convenience (you have to add them first).

The following example below (taken from the Delayed Data Manager) shows how data can be pulled from the database.

```python
import logging
from seleniumbase.core.mysql import DatabaseManager

def get_delayed_test_data(self, testcase_address, done=0):
    """ Returns a list of rows """
    db = DatabaseManager()
    query = """SELECT guid,testcaseAddress,insertedAt,expectedResult,done
               FROM delayedTestData
               WHERE testcaseAddress=%(testcase_address)s
               AND done=%(done)s"""
    data = db.fetchall_query_and_close(query, {"testcase_address":testcase_address, "done":done})
    if data:
        return data
    else:
        logging.debug("Could not find any rows in delayedTestData.")
        logging.debug("DB Query = " + query % {"testcase_address":testcase_address, "done":done})
        return []
```

Now you know how to pull data from your MySQL DB.

Delayed Data Manager usage example: If you scheduled an email to go out 12 hours from now and you wanted to check that the email gets received (but you don't want your test sitting idle for 12 hours) you can store the email credentials as a unique time-stamp for the email subject in the DB (along with a time for when it's safe for the email to be searched for) and then a later-running test can do the checking after the right amount of time has passed.

Description: mtprof
        ======
        
        A multi-thread aware profiler package, with an API similar to that
        of the standard ``cProfile`` module.
        
        Compatibility
        -------------
        
        Python 3 is required, and only POSIX systems (Linux, etc.) are currently
        supported.
        
        Limitations
        -----------
        
        Due to the way Python profiling works, ``mtprof`` is only able to exploit
        profiling stats from threads whose lifetime is a subset of the profiler's
        lifetime.  A thread started before profiling was started, or ended after
        profiling was stopped, cannot have its statistics collected.
        
        Due to this limitation, it is probably easier to use the command-line
        interface, which is similar to that of ``cProfile``: just run
        ``python -m mtprof --help`` to get a view of the available options.
        
        Only threads created using the standard ``threading.Thread`` interface
        are recognized.  For most use cases this should not be an issue.
        
        Status
        ------
        
        This package is experimental.

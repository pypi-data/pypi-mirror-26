Description: # SnapGeneFileReader
        a Python project to read and write Snapgene *.dna
        
        ## install
        ```bash
        pip install SnapGeneFileReader
        ```
        ## test:
        ```bash
        pytest
        ```
        ## usage:
        
        ### to read a SnapGene file into a dict
        ```python
        from SnapGeneFileReader import SnapGeneFileReader
        
        file_path = './snap_gene_file.dna'
        dna_dict = SnapGeneFileReader.read_file(file_path)
        ```
        
        ### to convert dna file to genbank file:
        ```python
        from Bio import SeqIO
        from SnapGeneFileReader import snapgene_file_to_seq_record
        
        file_path = './snap_gene_file.dna'
        
        seqObject = snapgene_file_to_seq_record(file_path)
        with open('genbank_file.gb', 'w') as f:
            SeqIO.write([seqObject,], f, 'genbank')
        ```

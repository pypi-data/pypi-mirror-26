Description: VIP - Vortex Image Processing package
        =====================================
        
        Introduction
        -------------
        
        VIP is a package/pipeline for angular, reference star and spectral 
        differential imaging for exoplanet/disk detection through high-contrast imaging.
        VIP is being developed in Python 2.7.
        
        VIP is being developed within the VORTEX team @ University of Liege (Belgium).
        Most of ``VIP``'s functionalities are mature but it doesn't mean it's
        free from bugs. The code will continue evolving and therefore all the feedback
        and contributions will be greatly appreciated. If you want to report a bug,
        suggest or add a functionality please create an issue or send a pull request on
        the github repository.

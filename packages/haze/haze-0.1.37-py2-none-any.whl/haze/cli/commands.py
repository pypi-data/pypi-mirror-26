There are a lot of properties for a given instance in EC2 that have
turned out to be really handy to access from bash scripts running on
the instance.

Trying to parse them directly in bash is more hassle than it is worth,
and I've written some of these toy attribute readers three or four times
because previous jobs never open sourced them.

Rewriting some of these handy attribute readers one last time in an Apache
licensed python module.

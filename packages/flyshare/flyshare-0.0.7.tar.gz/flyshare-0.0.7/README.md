# Flyshare

## Installation

To install pyfolio, run:

```bash
pip install flyshare
```

## Usage

A good way to get started is to run the flyshare examples in
a [Jupyter notebook](http://jupyter.org/). To do this, you first want to
start a Jupyter notebook server:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

From the notebook list page, navigate to the pyfolio examples directory
and open a notebook. Execute the code in a notebook cell by clicking on it
and hitting Shift+Enter.

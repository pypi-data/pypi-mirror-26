        driver27
        ========
        
        Racing competition manager in Django where you can manage different
        motor competitions with its own punctuation rules, races, drivers, teams
        which, at the same time, can be part of multiple competitions.
        
        Modify your settings.py
        =======================
        
        ::
        
            INSTALLED_APPS = [
                'bootstrap3',
            ...
                'django_countries',
                'tabbed_admin',
                'rest_framework', # since v0.19.3
                'django-filter', # since v0.22x
                'driver27'
            ]
        
        
            TABBED_ADMIN_USE_JQUERY_UI = False # Incompatible with 1.11.
        
        DR27_CONFIG
        ===========
        Now, you can add more punctuation and record configs adding DR27_CONFIG in your settings.py.
        Follow this example
        ::
        
            DR27_CONFIG = {
                'RECORDS': {
                    'PODIUM-GATES': {'label': _('At the gates of podium'), 'filter': {'finish__exact': 4}},
                    ...
                },
                'PUNCTUATION': {
                    'DR27-POINTS': {'type': 'full', 'finish': [10, 5, 3, 1], 'fastest_lap': 0, 'label': 'DR27 points'},
                    ...
                }
            }
        
        If you want to allow translate, add this import
        ::
        
            from django.utils.translation import ugettext as _

        0.16
        ====
        
        -  What would happen if the 10-point scoring system was used? Would the
           champion be the same? This version will give you the answer.
        -  Olympic rank: Alternative rank with the gold first method. The driver
           with superior race results (based on descending order, from number of
           wins to numbers of second-places down) will gain precedence.
        -  Road to championship: When the season goes down, we can calculate who
           would be the champion predicting the results in the last races.
           Olympic rank is counted in case of points tie. Rosberg or Hamilton?

        History
        =======
        
        Driver 27 is a reference to car number of Gilles Villeneuve, F1 Driver
        died in 1982. Gilles is considered one of best driver despite he never
        won the World Championship, something that Jacques Villeneuve, his son,
        did in 1998.
        
        In 1980's decade, F1 teams kept their numbers unless they were
        champions. This made Ferrari, the most legendary team of the F1, take
        that number for many years (1981-1995), making the number an icon of
        this sport.

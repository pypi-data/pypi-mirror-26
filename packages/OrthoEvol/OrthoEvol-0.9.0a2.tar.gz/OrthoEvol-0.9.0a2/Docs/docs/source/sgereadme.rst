SGE Documentation
=================

Collection of tools for using PBS, a job scheduler for high-performance
computing environments on SGE. The command is usually ``qsub <options>``
on most systems.

Usage & Examples
----------------

The main class under sge is ``SGEJob``, which provides functionality to
use the job sceduling system on a high performance computing (HPC)
cluster.

The ``Qstat`` class is also available for parsing the output of the
``qstat`` command.

The class currently provides a template, ``temp.pbs``, file to be
modified and used when submitting a job as well as default job
attributes.

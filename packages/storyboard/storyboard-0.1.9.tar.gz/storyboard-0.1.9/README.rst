``storyboard`` is an `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__-based customizable
video storyboard generator with metadata reporting directly embedded in
the generated images. Reported metadata fields include, but are not
limited to, title, filename, file size, SHA-1 digest, container format,
duration, pixel dimension, display aspect ratio (DAR), scan type
(progressive, interlaced, or telecined), frame rate, and per-stream
metadata (type, codec, profile, dimensions, bitrate, etc.). Scroll down
for a few sample storyboards.

Note that this README only provides an overview and summary of the
topics listed below. For more details, follow the main article link in
each section.

Background
----------

*Main article:* https://storyboard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html

``storyboard`` was inspired by the storyboards I frequently encounter on
video-sharing Internet forums, mostly generated by proprietary video
players. Those storyboards often come with video/file metadata bundled,
which I see as a great all-in-one solution for video sharing, saving
one the labor of typing multiple console commands, copying and pasting
output, and worrying about the forum's crappy formatting. However, I,
for one, dislike proprietary players. Also, those storyboards are
usually ugly and uninformative, using stupid fonts and lacking crucial
information that hackers look for (e.g., hash). Therefore, I developed
this customizable storyboard generator for hackers.

Installation and dependencies
-----------------------------

*Main article:* https://storyboard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html

Dependencies
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  `FFmpeg <https://ffmpeg.org/>`__. Check the `official downloads
   page <https://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html>`__ for installation
   options. On OS X you may install FFmpeg via
   `Homebrew <http://brew.sh>`__ or
   `MacPorts <https://www.macports.org/>`__. The former is recommended.

-  `Pillow <https://python-pillow.github.io/>`__. This dependency will
   be picked up by ``pip`` when you install ``storyboard``, but you also
   have to satisfy the external dependencies, especially ``libjpeg`` and
   ``libfreetype``. See `the official installation
   guide <https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html>`__ for
   details. (Satisfying external dependencies is very important on
   Linux, where no wheel distribution is provided on PyPI.)

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

End users should use ``pip``:

::

    pip install storyboard

Developers should clone the git repo for docs, tests, and more.

Command-line usage
------------------

*Main article:* https://storyboard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli.html

This package installs two console scripts, ``metadata`` and
``storyboard``. You may find documentation of both using the
``-h,--help`` option. Extensive documentation is also available for
both:

-  ``metadata`` CLI reference:
   `metadata-cli.html <https://storyboard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/metadata-cli.html>`__;
-  ``storyboard`` CLI reference:
   `storyboard-cli.html <https://storyboard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/storyboard-cli.html>`__.

By the way, the default invocation is really simple (for both): just
supply one or more video paths.

Issues
------

*Main article:* https://storyboard.readthedocs.io/en/latest/issue.html

Reporting
~~~~~~~~~

Please use the GitHub issue tracker:
https://github.com/zmwangx/storyboard/issues.

Known issues
~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  CJK support in filename and title? In short, no.

-  Found a codec you need that has no binding in ``metadata.py`` and
   leads to stupid output? File an issue or open a pull request. Please
   link a sample file if it is not commonly seen and cannot be encoded
   by FFmpeg.

-  ``ffprobe`` might report the wrong duration for certain VOB or other
   videos, which screws up the whole thing. As a fallback, you can use
   the option ``--video-duration`` of ``storyboard``. Note however that
   this option is extremely slow, and improving it is on my list.

  formats and codecs
* Much better error handling in many places (e.g., when duration is

  than throws)

  now you can build beautiful autodocs (I've yet to construct the
  manual part of the docs, so I won't release the docs to RTD or
  pythonhosted.org just yet)
* Integrated with Travis (Ubuntu), AppVeyor (Windows), Coveralls.io
  (web interface for coverage), and Landscape.io (Python code quality
  check -- basically linter as a CI) to ensure code quality

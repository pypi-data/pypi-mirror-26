Description: 
        PyObjC is a bridge between Python and Objective-C.  It allows full
        featured Cocoa applications to be written in pure Python.  It is also
        easy to use other frameworks containing Objective-C class libraries
        from Python and to mix in Objective-C, C and C++ source.
        
        This package is a pseudo-package that will install all pyobjc related
        packages (that is, pyobjc-core as well as wrapppers for frameworks on
        macOS)

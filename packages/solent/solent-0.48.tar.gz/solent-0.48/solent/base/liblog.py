# // overview
# Simple wrapper for logging. motive of this is that sometimes you
# want to be able to broadcast logs to the network rather than write to file.
# (yes, udp broadcast is unreliable, but for many applications it's damn
# useful). This library includes functionality that makes that easy.

    This initiates logging so that it will do a UDP broadcast of anything that
    comes in. UDP is an unreliable protocol, but for many applications this
    approach will be adequate.
    
    The broadcast message is not just the raw text. Rather, there is a short
    header of a couple of bytes indicating whether the message was from stdout
    or stderr. Look at the fingerprint section below for these values.

    It would probably be easy to adapt to qd_listen as a receiver of these
    messages. I have a more elaborate system hanging around that does this
    already ("orb_ancient_logger") and expect it will get incorporated to the
    solent codebase at some point.

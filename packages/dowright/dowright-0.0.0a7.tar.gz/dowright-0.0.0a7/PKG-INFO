        ========
        
        Simple YAML-based specification for creation and configuration of
        DigitalOcean droplets
        
        What is this for?
        -----------------
        
        This tool/library exists to:
        
        * provide a straightforward way to specify a particular set of
          DigitalOcean droplets and, given that specification,
        
        * create/destroy them in an idempotent manner and
        
        * provide an Ansible inventory for those droplets.
        
        The work was motivated by the "chicken/egg" problem of using a
        configuration management tool like Ansible on a yet-uncreated
        DigitalOcean droplet/service cluster. Ansible is certainly useful for
        deploying a configuration to an existing set of resources, and it even
        has an API for creating those resources on DigitalOcean.
        
        However, there wasn't a straightforward way of using Ansible to both
        create and configure the resources without having an inventory file
        hand-written prior to creation. If you changed the number of created
        droplets, you would have to hand-edit the inventory. With this
        tool, an existing set of Ansible roles can be used on a dynamic set of
        DigitalOcean droplets.
        
        ``dowright`` is for Python 3.4+ only with no plans for backwards
        compatibility.
        
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        * Install using ``pip3``::
        
            pip3 install dowright
           
        * Initialize the ``.tokenmanager.yml`` file in your home directory::
            
            python3 -m tokenmanager -i
        
        * Provide a ``digitalocean`` token namespace in your
          ``.tokenmanager.yml`` file. Then provide as many sub-namespaces as
          you need for your YAML specifications. These will then be specified
          in your YAML using the ``token`` key. E.g. ::
        
            digitalocean:
              app1: a1e1c084540b51b33af3c6b63d48ede2937c8df92f7e6e3beb1f630ac750b851
              app2: 03593464105708646cc04d847ffc81c5b7775c462f68b573f2aff5d933635e17
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        To use ``dowright``, you will need to create a YAML specification for
        your DigitalOcean resources. Here's an example spec (named
        ``my_web_app.yml``)::
        
          # token: this specifies which token reference under the
          #   "digitalocean" token group should be used for creating
          #   the droplets specified 
          token: app1 # using the above example of a .tokenmanager.yml file
        
          # prefix: is used to namespace your resources and is also
          #   provided as a tag for these resources at creation time
          prefix: my_web_app 
        
          # droplets: is a dictionary of named groups of resources. Each group
          #   corresponds to an Ansible inventory group and can be referenced
          #   as a group in various ways in this specification. 
          droplets:
            # Groups are lists of dictionaries that correspond to the creation
            #   parameters of the droplets to be created. Group names are also
            #   added as tags at creation time.
            data:
              - name: data[01:10]  # can use Ansible-style name expansions
                                   # to create multiple droplets with the same
                                   # name prefix and parameters
                size_slug: 2gb  # each key in the dictionary corresponds 1-to-1
                                # with the parameters given in the DigitalOcean
                                # droplet creation REST API 
                volumes:
                  - aaaaaaaa-bbbb-ffff-3333-000000000000
        
                # cloud_config_commands: is a special key that will be
                #   transformed into the "#cloud-config" YAML-formatted string
                #   under the "user_data" parameter. It is a list of bash shell
                #   commands that will be placed in the "runcmd" list of the
                #   "#cloud-config" string. In order to track completion of
                #   these commands, a final command (that creates a sentinel
                #   file "/.cloud-config-done") is appended by dowright.
                cloud_config_commands:
                  - mkdir /data
                  - mount -o defaults,nofail /dev/disk/by-id/scsi-0DO_Volume_volume-nyc1-01-part1 /data

        To link floating IPs to DigitalOcean droplets::
        
          python3 -m dowright my_web_app.yml -I
        
        To link DigitalOcean-managed domains to droplets::
        
          python3 -m dowright my_web_app.yml -d
        
        To create the Ansible inventory for your droplets::

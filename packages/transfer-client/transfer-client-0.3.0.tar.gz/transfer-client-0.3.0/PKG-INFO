Description: # Transfer client
        This package provides functions for communication with the Restful Transfer
        Server.
        
        ## Installation
        Via [pypi](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/transfer-client):
        
            pip install transfer_client
        
        From source:
        
            git clone https://git.lumc.nl/apis/transfer_client.git
            cd transfer_client
            pip install .
        
        ### Server certificate
        If the server uses a self-signed certificate, the administrator of the server
        needs to add this certificate to the list of trusted authorities (change
        `server_name` and `domain`):
        
            openssl s_client -connect server_name.domain:443 < /dev/null | \
              openssl x509 > /usr/local/share/ca-certificates/server_name.crt
            update-ca-certificates
        
        ## Configuration
        The client creates a configuration file named
        `.config/transfer_client/config.yml`. The `config` subcommand is used to
        manipulate this file.
        
        In the following example, we set the server to `server_name.domain`, add a
        project named `test` and set this project as the default project.
        
            transfer_client config set server server_name.domain
            transfer_client config add test "This is a placeholder."
            transfer_client config set project test
        
        By default, JSON is used as output format, but YAML is supported as well.
        
            transfer_client config set output_format yaml
        
        If the server certificate can not be installed, it might be convenient to
        disable the SSL certificate check by default.
        
            transfer_client config set ssl_check false
        
        List of all configuration variables:
        
            transfer_client config defaults
        
        List all projects:
        
            transfer_client config projects
        
        ## Command line interface
        Use the command `transfer_client -h` for a list of subcommands. For every
        subcommand a separate help is available, e.g.,
        
        ```
        $ transfer_client users -h
        usage: transfer_client users [-h] [-o OUTPUT] SERVER USER
        
        Gives a JSON object of a user together with its transfers.
        
        positional arguments:
          SERVER      server name
          USER        user id
        
        optional arguments:
          -h, --help  show this help message and exit
          -o OUTPUT   output file
          -n          disable ssl certificate check
        ```
        
        ### Typical usage
        The following high level subcommands are probably the only ones needed.
        
        To transfer a list of files, use the `transfer` subcommand. We assume that the
        server name is `server_name.domain` and the user ID is `xxxxxxxx`.
        
            transfer_client transfer server_name.domain xxxxxxxx *.gz
        
        A directory including its subdirectories can be transferred as a gzipped
        tarfile in chunks of 10G with the `transfer_dir` command. The receiver will see
        these chunks as files, together with a `README.md` containing unpacking
        instructions.
        
            transfer_client transfer_dir server_name.domain xxxxxxxx directory
        
        Any (possibly required) additional metadata can be passed to these functions
        via the `-a` parameter.
        
            transfer_client transfer -a other.json server_name.domain xxxxxxxx *.gz
        
        If a transfer is interrupted for some reason, it can be resumed with the
        `resume` subcommand.
        
            transfer_client resume server_name.domain xxxxxxxx
        
        To cancel an interrupted transfer, the `cancel` subcommand can be used.
        
            transfer_client cancel server_name.domain xxxxxxxx
        
        ### Other JSON schemas
        The client assumes the minimal JSON schema can be used. If this is not the
        case, the metadata needs to be generated beforehand. This metadata is used in a
        separate step to initiate the transfer with the `transfers` subcommand.
        
            tranfer_client transfers server_name.domain xxxxxxxx meta.json
        
        Now the `resume` command can be used to upload the data.
        
            transfer_client resume server_name.domain xxxxxxxx
        
        ## Library
        The library implements an interface to the API of the Restful Transfer server.
        Full documentation can be found [here](https://git.lumc.nl/j.k.vis/transfer).
        
        ### Usage
        To use the interface, we first make a class instance of `TransferClient`, then
        we can use the API endpoints.
        
        ```python
        >>> from transfer_client import TransferClient
        >>>
        >>> # Create a class instance for a server running on server_name.domain.
        >>> tc = TransferClient('server_name.domain')
        >>>
        >>> # Get user information together with its transfers.
        >>> tc.users('xxxxxxxx')
        { ... }
        ```

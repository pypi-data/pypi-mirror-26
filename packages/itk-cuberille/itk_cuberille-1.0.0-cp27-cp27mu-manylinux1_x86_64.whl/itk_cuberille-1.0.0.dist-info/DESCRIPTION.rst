This method operates by diving the surface into a number of small cubes called cuberilles. Each cuberille is centered at a pixel lying on the iso-surface and then quadrilaterals are generated for each face. The original approach is improved by projecting the vertices of each cuberille onto the implicit surface, smoothing the typical block-like resultant mesh.

How to install the Advene prototype

* Requirements:

** Video player

The video player is implemented on all platforms with the gstreamer
framework, through the python-gstreamer module (>= 1.0).

** Linux version

You will need the following python packages (the package names are from
Debian, they may slightly vary on other distributions) :

python >= 3.4
python3-gi
gir1.2-gstreamer-1.0
python3-gi-cairo
gir1.2-gtk-3.0 (>=3.4)
gir1.2-webkit-3.0
gir1.2-goocanvas-2.0
gir1.2-rsvg-2.0
python3-cherrypy3
python3-requests
python3-simpletal (>=3.12) [for convenience, a copy of simpletal may be
included in this Advene distribution]

For gstreamer, it is useful to also install the gstreamer packages
needed to decode various formats (esp. gstreamer1.0-plugins-bad and
gstreamer1.0-plugins-ugly).

Note that all these dependencies - except python3-simpletal - are
already available in Debian and in standard installations of Ubuntu.

When running on virtual machines (parallels, virtualbox...) : you must
select the X11 video output in Edit/Preferences/Video Player.

** Windows version

If you want to run Advene from sources on win32, you should install in this order (note the version numbers) :

- Python3 v. 3.4 (it could be a later version, but check that the PyGobject bindings support it): http://python.org/

- win32process from http://pywin32.sf.net/

- Python bindings for gtk/gstreamer and underlying libs from
https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject/OldIndex enabling support
for:
  - gdk-pixbuf
  - git2-glib
  - goocanvas
  - gstreamer and all gst-* packages
  - gtk
  - gtksourceview
  - pango
  - webkitgtk

- Cherrypy and requests: use pip (in the Scripts/ directory of the python directory)

  pip install cherrypy requests

- SimpleTAL (>=5.2) from
http://www.owlfish.com/software/simpleTAL/download.html [for
convenience, a copy of simpletal is included in this Advene
distribution]

** Mac OS X version

The new Advene code has not yet been tested in Mac OS X environement,
for lack of dedicated hardware. You can consider a donation :-) or try
yourself to install dependencies (python-gi, gtk, gstreamer) using the
linux install information.

* Testing

You can run the script ./bin/advene directly from the source
directory. It will detect that it is running from sources and adapt
its paths to this location.

In a first step, you can try the Advene application without movie player
support by using the "-pdummy" parameter :

  advene -pdummy

To force the use of the gstreamer player, specify:

  advene -pgstreamer

* Installing

To install the application, you can run the setup.py script with
appropriate options. For a standard installation, run

  python setup.py install

Note that it is not necessary to install the application to run it. It
can be used directly from its sources directory.

* Documentation

A user guide is in the public Advene wiki, feel free to contribute:
http://advene.org/wiki/

A summarized list of changes across versions is available in the
CHANGES.txt file.

* Debugging

Advene uses the standard python `logging` module for logging
purposes. The default level is INFO. To activate DEBUG messages for
specific modules, use the ADVENE_DEBUG environment variable which
holds a colon-separated list of module names for which to activate
debug messages. Every module is designated either by its dotted named
(e.g. advene.core.controller) or (if it is loaded through the plugin
framework) with undescore separators (e.g. advene_gui_views_timeline).

For instance, to debug the timelime view as well as the controller, you can use

ADVENE_DEBUG=advene.core.controller:advene_gui_views_timeline ./bin/advene

The "-d" option activates some specific code paths. Among other
things, it loads the advene.util.debug module.

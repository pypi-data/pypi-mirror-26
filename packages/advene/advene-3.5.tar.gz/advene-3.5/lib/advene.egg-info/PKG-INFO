Description: Annotate DVds, Exchange on the NEt
        
         The Advene (Annotate DVd, Exchange on the NEt) project is aimed
         towards communities exchanging discourses (analysis, studies) about
         audiovisual documents (e.g. movies) in DVD format. This requires that
         audiovisual content and hypertext facilities be integrated, thanks to
         annotations providing explicit structures on  audiovisual streams, upon
         which hypervideo documents can be engineered.
         .
         The cross-platform Advene application allows users to easily
         create comments and analyses of video comments, through the
         definition of time-aligned annotations and their mobilisation
         into automatically-generated or user-written comment views (HTML
         documents). Annotations can also be used to modify the rendition
         of the audiovisual document, thus providing virtual montage,
         captioning, navigation... capabilities. Users can exchange their
         comments/analyses in the form of Advene packages, independently from
         the video itself.
         .
         The Advene framework provides models and tools allowing to design and reuse
         annotations schemas; annotate video streams according to these schemas;
         generate and create Stream-Time Based (mainly video-centred) or User-Time
         Based (mainly text-centred) visualisations of the annotations. Schemas
         (annotation- and relation-types), annotations and relations, queries and
         views can be clustered and shared in units called packages. Hypervideo
         documents are generated when needed, both from packages (for annotation and
         view description) and DVDs (audiovisual streams).

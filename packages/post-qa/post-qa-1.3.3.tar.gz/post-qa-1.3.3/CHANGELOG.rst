1.2.0 [2016-10-15]

- Update shims to work with `validate_base <https://github.com/lsst/validate_base>`_ -type Job JSON (as of `DM-7042 <https://jira.lsstcorp.org/browse/DM-7042>`_). The JSON created for SQUASH is unchanged.
- There is now a `schema <http://json-schema.org>`_ for the JSON submitted to SQUASH. See ``postqa/schemas/squash.json`` and the ``postqa.schemas`` module. Tests use this schema with the ``jsonschema`` package to validate output JSON.

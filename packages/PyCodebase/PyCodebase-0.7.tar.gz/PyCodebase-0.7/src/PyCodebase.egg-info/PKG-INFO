Description: About PyCodebase
        ================
        
        PyCodebase is a client for the
        `Codebase <https://www.codebasehq.com/>`__ API. It works in Python 2.7.
        The `source code and project lives on
        GitHub <https://github.com/davidwtbuxton/pycodebase>`__.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        
        You can install from PyPI:
        
        ::
        
            $ pip install pycodebase
        
        Usage
        -----
        
        First you need a client to connect to Codebase. You can pass a 2-tuple
        of your API username and key:
        
        ::
        
            import codebase
        
            # Your API username and key, shown on Codebase's profile page.
            secrets = ('example/alice', 'abc123def456')
            client = codebase.Client(secrets)
        
        An alternative is to create a file with the username and key:
        
        ::
        
            $ cat ~/.codebase.ini
            [api]
        
            username = example/alice
            key = abc123def456
        
        You can then create the client, telling it the path of your secrets
        file.
        
        ::
        
            import codebase
        
            client = codebase.Client.with_secrets('~/.codebase.ini')
        
        From there you can get projects in your account and all the ticket and
        status information related to those projects.

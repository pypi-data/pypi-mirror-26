About PyCodebase
================

PyCodebase is a client for the [Codebase][codebase] API. It works in Python 2.7. The [source code and project lives on GitHub][project].


Installation
------------

You can install from PyPI:

    $ pip install pycodebase


Usage
-----

First you need a client to connect to Codebase. You can pass a 2-tuple of your API username and key:

    import codebase

    # Your API username and key, shown on Codebase's profile page.
    secrets = ('example/alice', 'abc123def456')
    client = codebase.Client(secrets)

An alternative is to create a file with the username and key:

    $ cat ~/.codebase.ini
    [api]

    username = example/alice
    key = abc123def456

You can then create the client, telling it the path of your secrets file.

    import codebase

    client = codebase.Client.with_secrets('~/.codebase.ini')

From there you can get projects in your account and all the ticket and status information related to those projects.

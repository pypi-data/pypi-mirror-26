`OpenFermion <http://openfermion.org>`__ is an open source library (licensed under Apache 2) for compiling and analyzing quantum algorithms which simulate fermionic systems.
This plugin library allows the electronic structure package `PySCF <http://github.com/sunqm/pyscf>`__ (licensed under BSD-2-Clause) to interface with OpenFermion.

Installation
------------

To start using OpenFermion-PySCF, first install `PySCF
<http://github.com/sunqm/pyscf>`__.
Then, to install the latest versions of OpenFermion and OpenFermion-PySCF (in development mode):

.. code-block:: bash

  git clone https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-PySCF
  cd OpenFermion-PySCF
  python -m pip install -e .

Alternatively, to install the latest PyPI releases as libraries (in user mode):

.. code-block:: bash

  python -m pip install --user openfermionpyscf

Also be sure to take a look at the `ipython notebook demo <https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-PySCF/blob/master/examples/openfermionpyscf_demo.ipynb>`__.

How to contribute
-----------------

We'd love to accept your contributions and patches to OpenFermion-PySCF.
There are a few guidelines you need to follow.
Contributions to OpenFermion-PySCF must be accompanied by a Contributor License Agreement.

We use GitHub pull requests for this purpose. Consult
`GitHub Help <https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/>`__ for
more information on using pull requests.
Furthermore, please make sure your new code comes with extensive tests!
We use automatic testing to make sure all pull requests pass tests and do not
decrease overall test coverage by too much. Make sure you adhere to our style
guide. Just have a look at our code for clues. We mostly follow
`PEP 8 <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`_ and use
the corresponding `linter <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pep8>`_ to check for it.
Code should always come with documentation.

Description-Content-Type: UNKNOWN
Description: MICtools is an open source pipeline which combines the
        TIC_e and MIC_e measures into a two-step procedure that allows to
        identify relationships of various degrees of complexity in large datasets. TIC_e
        is used to perform efficiently a high throughput screening of all the possible
        pairwise relationships assessing their significance, while MIC_e is used to rank 
        the subset of significant associations on the bases of their strength. Homepage:

PredictionIO Python SDK

PredictionIO is a prediction server for building smart
applications. While you search data through a database
server, you can make prediction through PredictionIO.

With PredictionIO, you can write apps

- that predict user behaviors based on solid data
  science
- using your choice of state-of-the-art machine
  learning algorithms
- without worrying about scalability

Detailed documentation is available on our
`documentation site <http://predictionio.apache.org/>`_.

This module provides convenient access of the
PredictionIO API to Python programmers so that they
can focus on their application logic.

Summary
-------
It's supposed to tell your fortune for today (or maybe for a specific date).
It should also tell something like "A(n) `<adjective>` or `<verb>` `<noun>` has foreseen your future." or something funny.

For example: ::

    A talking pineapple has foreseen your future: <horoscope goes here>.

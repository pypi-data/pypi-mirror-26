Battray is a fairly simple tray icon to show your laptop’s battery status.
It's simple, easy, fairly environment-independent, and ‘just works’ without
tons of {Gnome,KDE,..} dependencies.

You can also configure it to play annoying sounds if your battery is getting low,
dim the screen when you switch from AC to battery, etc.

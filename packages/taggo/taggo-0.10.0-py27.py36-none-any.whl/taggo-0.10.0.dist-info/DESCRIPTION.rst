Tag organizer that uses names of files and folders to create symlinks.
Tags are defined by using #hashtags in the name. They can also be as many sub levels as you want, like #sub-hash-tag

**note**
This version should work now, but the "old" version is still tagged at https://github.com/xeor/taggo/tree/0.2.
The old version worked fine at python 2 (but not 3). It also had config-file instead of parameters. Check out the
repo if you want it..

FAQ
---

* Why the name taggo?

  * It's a tagging tool. It does stuff with tags. What do you suggest? Tagging, taggs, tags, tag2fold... no.. Taggo!

* Why do you want to create tags with symlinks?

  * Because everyone have underestimated the power of tagging data.
  * Photo filenames are just wasted, what does DCIM1234.jpg tell you?
  * You know you miss one folder that contains all your dog pictures.
  * You sould not depend on a 3rd party program/database to manage
    your files/photos.

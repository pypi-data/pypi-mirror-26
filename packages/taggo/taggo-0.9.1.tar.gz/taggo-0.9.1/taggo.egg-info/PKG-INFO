        Tag organizer that uses names of files and folders to create symlinks.
        Tags are defined by using #hashtags in the name. They can also be as many sub levels as you want, like #sub-hash-tag
        
        **note**
        This version should work now, but the "old" version is still tagged at https://github.com/xeor/taggo/tree/0.2.
        The old version worked fine at python 2 (but not 3). It also had config-file instead of parameters. Check out the
        repo if you want it..

        Any questions, thoughts, bugs are very welcome!
        
        
        Requirements

        What it does
        ------------
        
        Taggo creates symlinks based on hashtags it finds in the file or foldername.
        
        Here are some examples
        
        .. list-table:: Filename examples
           :widths: 10 40
           :header-rows: 1
        
           * - Fil/folder names
             - Creates
           * - A random name.jpg
             -
           * - dcim1234 #People-Lars #food.jpg
             - 1 link in a folder People/Lars/... and one in food/
           * - 2012-09-25 Oslo tour #Earth-Europe-Norway-Oslo/dcim123...
             - Link to the folder under Earth/Europe/Norway/Oslo/2012-09-25....
           * - dcim123,#tag1.jpg
             - Link to the file under tag1/
           * - dcim321#tag2.jpg
             - Nothing, a tag needs a space, . or , in front and back of the tag.
        
        FAQ
        ---
        
        * Why the name taggo?
        
          * It's a tagging tool. It does stuff with tags. What do you suggest? Tagging, taggs, tags, tag2fold... no.. Taggo!
        
        * Why do you want to create tags with symlinks?
        
          * Because everyone have underestimated the power of tagging data.
          * Photo filenames are just wasted, what does DCIM1234.jpg tell you?
          * You know you miss one folder that contains all your dog pictures.
          * You sould not depend on a 3rd party program/database to manage
            your files/photos.

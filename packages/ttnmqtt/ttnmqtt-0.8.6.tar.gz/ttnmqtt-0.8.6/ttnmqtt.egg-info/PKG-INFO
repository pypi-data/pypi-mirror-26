Description: Documentation for ttnmqtt python package
        ========================================
        
        This package provide you an easy way to connect to The Things Network
        via MQTT. Take note that, you'll need to have already created an
        application with a device to run the constructor of the MQTT client for
        you need to provide, an applicationID and a deviceID. First include the
        package in your file like this:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            from ttnmqtt import MQTTClient as mqtt
        
        Constructor
        -----------
        
        The class constructor can ba called following this scheme:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            mqtt(APPID, APPEUI, PSW, DEVID)
        
        All the following information can be found in your The Things Network
        console. *APPID*: this the name you gave your application when it was
        created *APPEUI*: this the unique identifier of your application on TTN
        platform *DEVID*: this the name you gave to your device when it was
        added to the application. It's an optional argument, so you don't have
        to provide it to create your client. However, if you try to publish a
        message to your application, you'll need to set up the deviceID to which
        you want to send the message with the following method:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            client.setDeviceID(DEVID)
        
        *PSW*: can be found at the bottom of your application page under
        **ACCESS KEYS**
        
        this function returns an MQTTClient object set with your application
        information, ready for connection.
        
        Connection
        ----------
        
        Once you created your client, you need to connect it to the TTN MQTT
        broker.
        
        .. code:: python
        
            client.connect()
        
        *client* is the object you previously created. We simply call the
        connect() method on it which by default connect you to
        **eu.thethings.network** via 1883 port. If you wish to connect with
        another configuration, use the following function with the following
        arguments:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            client.customConnect(region, port)
        
        the **port** argument is optional (by default it's 1883) but the
        **region** is mandatory.
        
        Start and Stop loops
        --------------------
        
        Our client is now connected to the broker but we need to set a loop for
        it to keep listenning for potential incomming messages (take note that
        we **don't** need to start a loop if we simply want to send downlink
        messages). Two different options are possible: \* The loop is your main
        process: In that case you need to start the loop like this:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            client.start()
        
        Please take note that you wont be able to run any other process at the
        same time and other functions will be executed once the loop is stopped
        with:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            client.disconnect()
        
        -  The loop needs to be run as a background process: In that case start
           looping with the following method:
        
           .. code:: python
        
               client.startBackground()
        
           This way you will be able to run other process (such as the web
           server for example) at the same time. Stop the loop with this method:
        
           .. code:: python
        
               client.stopBackground()
        
           This method will also disconnect your client.
        
        Access messages
        ---------------
        
        Now that our client is connected and looping, we will be able to receive
        uplink messages. On each message reception, you should be **MESSAGE
        RECEIVED** in the console. Our object/client has two methods that you
        can call to access the messages:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            # returns the last message received
            client.getLastMessage()
            # returns all the messages received to this point and since the client was created
            client.getAllMessages()
        
        Publish
        -------
        
        If you wish to publish a message to the device you passed in argument
        while creating the client you can do so, using the following method:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            client.publish(message)
        
        The messages that you send to the TTN broker need to be strings and can
        follow this example (it's not mendatory but they are mostly build on
        this format):
        ``json  {"port": 1, "confirmed": false, "payload_raw": "AA=="}`` This
        message will send the payload 00 to your device.
        
        Set custom behaviors
        --------------------
        
        While calling the connect function, default behaviors are set for the
        following events triggering our client: connection, receiving messages
        and publishing messages. However is you wish to redefine them you can by
        calling the follwing methods:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            client.setConnectBehavior(custom_function)
            client.setMessageBehavior(custom_function)
            client.setPublishBehavior(custom_function)
            client.setGlobalBehavior(custom_connect, custom_message, custom_publish)
        
        The custom functions need to be defined in your project and accessible
        from where you are setting the behaviors. They also need to follow the
        paho-mqtt standart which is the following:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            custom_message(client, userdata, message)
            custom_connect(client, userdata, falgs, rc)
            custom_publish(client, userdata, mid)
        
        for more information over paho-mqtt package go to :
        https://pypi.python.org/pypi/paho-mqtt/1.3.0
        
        Set a message handler
        ---------------------
        
        If you simply wish to execute a few instructions when receiving a
        message, such as a data treament or store the message or informations
        that you received it's much advised to set a message handler instead of
        redefining the message behavior of the client. Where you create the
        client, define a procedure without arguments (this is very important
        that your procedure doesn't take any arguments) where you put the
        instructions to be executed when you receive a new message. Then call
        the following method:
        
        .. code:: python
        
            def customHandler():
              print('My personnal handler!')
        
            client.setMessageHandler(customHandler)
        
        Everytime you receive a new message, the customHandler() function will
        be executed and no need to worry about the paho-mqtt syntax.
        
        Bear in mind
        ------------
        
        If for whatever reason you decide to create more than one client
        connecting to the same application, be carefull because your new clients
        will use the already existing connection so you wont se any connection
        message in the console

Biotite project
===============

The *Biotite* package bundles popular tasks in computational biology into an
unifying framework, which is easy to use on the one hand side, but is also
computationally efficient due to intensive usage *NumPy* and
*Cython*.  This package focuses on working with sequence and structure data and
supports various file formats and analysis and manipulation functions.

More information on this project can be found on the
`offical website <https://pythonhosted.org/biotite/>`_.

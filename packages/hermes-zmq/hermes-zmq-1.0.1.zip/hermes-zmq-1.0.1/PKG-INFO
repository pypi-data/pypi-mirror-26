        Hermes
        ======
        ZMQ-based framework for building simple Pub-Sub Systems, written in Python 3.
        
        It offers thread-based wrappers for zmq's SUB and PUB sockets, a pre-configured proxy device
        and a Node class to pull it all together.
        
        Hermes allows you to quickly build a cluster of publishers which can support arbitrary numbers
        of subscribers via single address.
        
        Motivation
        ==========
        Hermes is the base for our Crypto trading system, and allows us to set up new node clusters in a
        convenient and maintainable way, without our contributors having to worry too much about the inner
        workings of ZMQ.
        
        We liked it, so we decided to publish it!
        
        
        Usage
        =====
        
        install via ``pip install hermes-zmq`` and import with ``import hermes``.

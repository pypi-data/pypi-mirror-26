SPORCO is a Python package for solving optimisation problems with
sparsity-inducing regularisation. These consist primarily of sparse
coding and dictionary learning problems, including convolutional
sparse coding and dictionary learning, but there is also support for
other problems such as Total Variation regularisation and Robust
PCA. In the current version all of the optimisation algorithms are
based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM).

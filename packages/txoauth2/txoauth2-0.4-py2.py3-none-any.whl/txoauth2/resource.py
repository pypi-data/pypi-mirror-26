    """
    This resource handles the authorization process by the user.

    Clients that want to get tokens need to send the user to
    this resource to start the authorization process.
    While configuring the client, one needs to specify the address
    of this resource as the "Authorization Endpoint".

    Authorization Flow:
    1: A client sends the user to this resource and sends the parameter state, client_id,
       response_type, scope, and redirect_uri as query parameters of the (GET) request.
    2: After validating the parameters, this class calls onAuthenticate. At this point one
       could redirect to a login page an then send the user back when they are logged in.
    3: onAuthenticate need to show the user a html page which explains that they allow the client
       access to all resources which require the permissions in 'scope'.
    4a: If the user denies access, you need to call denyAccess.
    4b: If the user agrees, you need to call grantAccess and the user is then redirected to
        one of the returnUris of the client. The request to the redirect url will contain a
        code in the url parameters. The code does not grant access to the scope and has a very
        short lifetime.
    5: The client uses the code to get a token from the TokenEndpoint.

# Lavatory

Tooling to define repository specific retention policies in Artifactory. Allows highly customizable
retention policies via Python plugins. 

## Authentication

This tool looks for 3 enviroment variables in order to authenticate:

`ARTIFACTORY_URL` - Base URL to use for Artifactory connections

`ARTIFACTORY_USERNAME` - Username to Artifactory

`ARTIFACTORY_PASSWORD` - Password for Artifactory

These will be loaded in at the beginning of a run and raise an exception if missing.

This is a simple calculator. Enter a date and it will calculate the years
until that date.

The intent is to calculate the float years until a bond matures,
but it really could be for anything.

It also has a function that provides the appropriate
US Treasury bond benchmark. Somebody trying to price a bond using relative
valuation might find this helpful.

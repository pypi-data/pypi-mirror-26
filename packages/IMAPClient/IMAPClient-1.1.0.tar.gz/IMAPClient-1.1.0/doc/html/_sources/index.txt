Introduction
------------
IMAPClient is an easy-to-use, Pythonic and complete IMAP client
library.

Although IMAPClient actually uses the imaplib module from the Python
standard library under the hood, it provides a different API. Instead
of requiring that the caller performs extra parsing work, return
values are full parsed, readily usable and use sensible Python
types. Exceptions are raised when problems occur (no error checking of
return values is required).

IMAPClient is straight forward it use, but it can be useful to have at
least a general understanding of the IMAP protocol. :rfc:`3501`
explains IMAP in detail. Other RFCs also apply to various extensions
to the base protocol. These are referred to in the documentation below
where relevant.

Python versions 2.6, 2.7, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5 and 3.6 are officially supported.

A Simple Example
----------------
The core of the IMAPClient API is the IMAPClient class. Instantiating
this class, creates a connection to an IMAP account. Calling methods
on the IMAPClient instance interacts with the server.

The following example shows a simple interaction with an IMAP
server. It displays the message ID, size and IMAP flags of all
non-deleted messages in the INBOX folder.

.. literalinclude:: ../../imapclient/examples/example.py

The output from this example could look something like this

::

    96 messages in INBOX
    75 messages that aren't deleted

    Messages:
       ID 38273: 1775 bytes, flags=(b'NonJunk',)
       ID 36459: 2833 bytes, flags=(b'\\Flagged', v'\\Seen')
       ID 34693: 2874 bytes, flags=(b'\\Flagged', v'\\Seen')
       ID 38066: 5368 bytes, flags=(b'\\Flagged', v'\\Seen')
       ID 38154: 9079 bytes, flags=(b'\\Seen', b'NonJunk')
       ID 14099: 3322 bytes, flags=(b'\\Flagged', b'\\Seen', b'$Label1')
       ID 34196: 9163 bytes, flags=(b'\\Answered', b'\\Seen')
       ID 35349: 4266 bytes, flags=(b'\\Flagged', b'\\Seen')
       ID 29335: 5617 bytes, flags=(b'\\Flagged', b'\\Seen', b'NonJunk')
       ID 38041: 7649 bytes, flags=(b'\\Seen', b'NonJunk')
       ID 22310: 976108 bytes, flags=(b'\\Flagged', b'\\Seen', b'$Label1')
       ID 6439: 3792 bytes, flags=(b'\\Flagged', b'\\Seen', b'$Label1', b'Junk')


Concepts
--------

Message Identifiers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the IMAP protocol, messages are identified using an integer. These
message ids are specific to a given folder.

There are two types of message identifiers in the IMAP protocol.

One type is the message sequence number where the messages in a folder
are numbered from 1 to N where N is the number of messages in the
folder. These numbers don't persist between sessions and may be
reassigned after some operations such as an expunge.

A more convenient approach is Unique Identifiers (UIDs). Unique
Identifiers are integers assigned to each message by the IMAP server
that will persist across sessions. They do not change when folders are
expunged. Almost all IMAP servers support UIDs.

Each call to the IMAP server can use either message sequence numbers
or UIDs in the command arguments and return values. The client
specifies to the server which type of identifier should be used. You
can set whether IMAPClient should use UIDs or message sequence number
via the *use_uid* argument passed when an IMAPClient instance is
created and the *use_uid* attribute. The *use_uid* attribute can be
used to change the message id type between calls to the
server. IMAPClient uses UIDs by default.

Any method that accepts message ids takes either a sequence containing
message ids (eg. ``[1,2,3]``), or a single message id integer, or a
string representing sets and ranges of messages as supported by the
IMAP protocol (e.g. ``'50-65'``, ``'2:*'`` or ``'2,4:7,9,12:*'``).

Message Flags
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An IMAP server keeps zero or more flags for each message. These
indicate certain properties of the message or can be used by IMAP
clients to keep track of data related to a message.

The IMAPClient package has constants for a number of commmonly used flags::

    DELETED = br'\Deleted'
    SEEN = br'\Seen'
    ANSWERED = br'\Answered'
    FLAGGED = br'\Flagged'
    DRAFT = br'\Draft'
    RECENT = br'\Recent'         # This flag is read-only

Any method that accepts message flags takes either a sequence
containing message flags (eg. ``[DELETED, 'foo', 'Bar']``) or a single
message flag (eg.  ``'Foo'``).

Folder Name Encoding
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Any method that takes a folder name will accept a standard string or a
unicode string. Unicode strings will be transparently encoded using
modified UTF-7 as specified by :rfc:`3501#section-5.1.3`.  This allows
for arbitrary unicode characters (eg. non-English characters) to be
used in folder names.

The ampersand character ("&") has special meaning in IMAP folder
names. IMAPClient automatically escapes and unescapes this character
so that the caller doesn't have to.

Automatic folder name encoding and decoding can be enabled or disabled
with the *folder_encode* attribute. It defaults to True.

If *folder_encode* is True, all folder names returned by IMAPClient
are always returned as unicode strings. If *folder_encode* is False,
folder names are returned as str (Python 2) or bytes (Python 3).

TLS/SSL
~~~~~~~
IMAPClient uses sensible TLS parameter defaults for encrypted
connections and also allows for a high level of control of TLS
parameters if required. To provide a consistent API and capabilities
across Python versions the `backports.ssl <https://github.com/alekstorm/backports.ssl>`_
library is used instead of the standard library ssl
package. backports.ssl provides an API that aims to mimic the Python
3.4 ssl package so it should be familiar to developers that have used
the ssl package in recent versions of Python.

TLS parameters are controlled by passing a ``backports.ssl.SSLContext``
when creating an IMAPClient instance. When ``ssl=True`` is used
without passing a SSLContext, a default context is used. The default
context avoids the use of known insecure ciphers and SSL protocol
versions, with certificate verification and hostname verification
turned on. The default context will use system installed certificate
authority trust chains, if available.

:py:func:`IMAPClient.tls.create_default_context` returns IMAPClient's
default context. When constructing a custom context it is usually best
to start with the default context and modify it to suit your needs.

The following example shows how to to disable certification
verification and certificate host name checks if required.

.. literalinclude:: ../../imapclient/examples/tls_no_checks.py

The next example shows how to create a context that will use custom CA
certificate. This is required to perform verification of a self-signed
certificate used by the IMAP server.

.. literalinclude:: ../../imapclient/examples/tls_cacert.py

The above examples show some of the most common TLS parameter
customisations but there are many other tweaks are possible. Consult
the Python 3 :py:mod:`ssl` package documentation for further options.

Old pyOpenSSL Versions
+++++++++++++++++++++++

IMAPClient's TLS functionality will not behaviour correctly if an
out-of-date version of pyOpenSSL is used. On some systems
(particularly OS X) the system installed version of pyOpenSSL will
take precedence over any user installed version. Use of virtualenvs is
strongly encouraged to work around this.

IMAPClient checks the installed pyOpenSSL version at import time and
will fail early if an old pyOpenSSL version is found.

Using gevent with IMAPClient
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Some extra monkey patching is required so that the gevent_ package can
work with pyOpenSSL (used by IMAPClient for TLS support). The
`gevent_openssl`_ package performs this patching. Please use
gevent_openssl 1.2 or later.

Here's an example of how gevent_openssl can be used with IMAPClient::

  from gevent import monkey; monkey.patch_all()
  import gevent_openssl; gevent_openssl.monkey_patch()

  import imapclient

  client = imapclient.IMAPClient(...)
  ...

.. _gevent: http://www.gevent.org/
.. _`gevent_openssl`: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gevent_openssl/


Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~
The following exceptions may be raised by IMAPClient directly. They
are attached to the IMAPClient class.

* IMAPClient.Error: the base class for IMAPClient's exceptions and the
  most commonly used error.
* IMAPClient.AbortError: raised if a serious error has occurred that
  means the IMAP connection is no longer usable. The connection should
  be dropped without logout if this occurs.
* IMAPClient.ReadOnlyError: raised if a modifying operation was
  attempted on a read-only folder.

Exceptions from lower network layers are also possible, in particular:

* socket.error
* socket.timeout: raised if a timeout was specified when creating the
  IMAPClient instance and a network operation takes too long.
* backports.ssl.SSLError: the base class for network or SSL protocol
  errors when ssl=True or starttls() is used.
* backports.ssl.CertificateError: raised when TLS certification
  verification fails. This is *not* a subclass of SSLError.

API Reference
-------------

IMAPClient Class
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The primary class used by the imapclient package is the IMAPClient
class. All interaction with a remote IMAP server is performed via an
IMAPClient instance.

.. autoclass:: imapclient.IMAPClient
   :members:

Fetch Response Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Various types may be used in the data structures returned by
:py:meth:`.IMAPClient.fetch` when certain response types
are encountered during parsing.

.. automodule:: imapclient.response_types
   :members:

TLS Support
~~~~~~~~~~~

.. automodule:: imapclient.tls
   :members:

Interactive Sessions
--------------------
When developing program using IMAPClient is it sometimes useful to
have an interactive shell to play with. IMAPClient ships with a module
that lets you fire up an interactive shell with an IMAPClient instance
connected to an IMAP server.

Start a session like this::

   python -m imapclient.interact -H <host> -u <user> ...

Various options are available to specify the IMAP server details. See
the help (--help) for more details. You'll be prompted for a username
and password if one isn't provided on the command line.

It is also possible to pass connection details as a configuration file
like this::

   python -m imapclient.interact -f <config file>

See below for details of the :ref:`configuration file format<conf-files>`.

If installed, IPython will be used as the embedded shell. Otherwise
the basic built-in Python shell will be used.

The connected IMAPClient instance is available as the variable
"c". Here's an example session::

    $ python -m imapclient.interact -H <host> -u <user> ...
    Connecting...
    Connected.

    IMAPClient instance is "c"
    In [1]: c.select_folder('inbox')
    Out[1]: 
    {b'EXISTS': 2,
     b'FLAGS': (b'\\Answered',
         b'\\Flagged',
         b'\\Deleted',
         b'\\Seen',
         b'\\Draft'),
     b'PERMANENTFLAGS': (b'\\Answered',
         b'\\Flagged',
         b'\\Deleted',
         b'\\Seen',
         b'\\Draft'),
     b'READ-WRITE': True,
     b'RECENT': 0,
     b'UIDNEXT': 1339,
     b'UIDVALIDITY': 1239278212}

    In [2]: c.search()
    Out[2]: [1123, 1233]

    In [3]: c.logout()
    Out[3]: b'Logging out'

.. _conf-files:

Configuration File Format
-------------------------
Both the IMAPClient interactive shell and the live tests take
configuration files which specify how to to connect to an IMAP
server. The configuration file format is the same for both.

Configuration files use the INI format and must always have a section
called ``DEFAULT``. Here's a simple example::

    [DEFAULT]
    host = imap.mailserver.com
    username = bob
    password = sekret
    ssl = True

The supported options are:

==================== ======= =========================================================================================
Name                 Type    Description
==================== ======= =========================================================================================
host                 string  IMAP hostname to connect to.
username             string  The username to authenticate as.
password             string  The password to use with ``username``.
port                 int     Server port to connect to. Defaults to 143 unless ``ssl`` is True.
ssl                  bool    Use SSL/TLS to connect.
starttls             bool    Use STARTTLS to connect.
ssl_check_hostname   bool    If true and SSL is in use, check that certificate matches the hostname (defaults to true)
ssl_verify_cert      bool    If true and SSL is in use, check that the certifcate is valid (defaults to true).
ssl_ca_file          string  If SSL is true, use this to specify certificate authority certs to validate with.
timeout              int     Time out I/O operations after this many seconds.
oauth2               bool    If true, use OAUTH2 to authenticate (``username`` and ``password`` are ignored).
oauth2_client_id     string  OAUTH2 client id.
oauth2_client_secret string  OAUTH2 client secret.
oauth2_refresh_token string  OAUTH2 token for refreshing the secret.
==================== ======= =========================================================================================

Acceptable boolean values are "1", "yes", "true", and "on", for true;
and "0", "no", "false", and "off", for false.

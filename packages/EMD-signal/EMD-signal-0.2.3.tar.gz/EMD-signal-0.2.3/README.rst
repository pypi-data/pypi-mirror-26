Introduction
************

This is yet another Python implementation of Empirical Mode
Decomposition (EMD). The package contains many EMD variations and intends to
deliver more in time.

EMD variations:
    - Ensemble EMD (EEMD),
    - Image decomposotion (EMD2D),
    - different settings and configurations of vanilla EMD.

*PyEMD* allows to use different splines for envelopes, stopping criteria
and extrema interpolation.

Available splines:
    - Natural cubic [default] 
    - Pointwise cubic 
    - Akima 
    - Linear

Available stopping criteria: 
    - Cauchy convergence [default] 
    - Fixed number of iterations 
    - Number of consecutive proto-imfs

Extrema detection: 
    - Discrete extrema [default] 
    - Parabolic interpolation

Installation
************

Recommended
===========

Simply download this directory either directly from GitHub, or using command line:

    $ git clone https://github.com/laszukdawid/PyEMD

Then go into the downloaded project and run from command line:

    $ python setup.py install


PyPi
====
Packaged obtained from PyPi is/will be slightly behind this project, so some features might not be the same. However, it seems to be the easiest/nicest way of installing any Python packages, so why not this one?

    $ pip install EMD-signal


Example
*******

More detailed examples are included in documentation. 

EMD
===

In most cases default settings are enough. Simply
import ``EMD`` and pass your signal to instance or to ``emd()`` method.

.. code:: python

    from PyEMD import EMD
    import numpy as np

    s = np.random.random(100)
    emd = EMD()
    IMFs = emd(s)

The Figure below was produced with input:
:math:`S(t) = cos(22 \pi t^2) + 6t^2`

EEMD
====

Simplest case of using Esnembld EMD (EEMD) is by importing ``EEMD`` and passing
your signal to the instance or ``eemd()`` method.

.. code:: python

    from PyEMD import EEMD
    import numpy as np

    s = np.random.random(100)
    eemd = EEMD()
    eIMFs = eemd(s)

EMD2D
=====

Simplest case is to pass image as monochromatic numpy 2D array.
As with other modules one can use default setting of instance or
more expliclity use ``emd2d()`` method.

.. code:: python

    from PyEMD import EMD2D
    import numpy as np

    x, y = np.arange(128), np.arange(128).reshape((-1,1))
    img = np.sin(0.1*x)*np.cos(0.2*y)
    emd2d = EMD2D()
    IMFs_2D = emd2d(img)

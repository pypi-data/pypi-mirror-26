Introduction
============

Some Greek-letter organizations assign big brothers or big sisters ("bigs") to
new members ("littles"). This program visualizes such relationships as a family
tree, using Graphviz.

Usage
=====

Basic Usage
-----------

The simplest usage of ``snutree`` is:

.. code:: bash

    snutree -o output.pdf input1.csv input2.csv ...

In this example, the CSV should have columns called ``name``, ``big_name``, and
``semester`` where ``semester``\s are strings starting with "Fall" or "Spring"
and ending with a year (e.g., "Fall 2014" or "Spring 1956"). With this input,
``snutree`` will append all the input tables together, convert them into a
tree, and output the tree using Graphviz. Each member will be put on a row
representing the semester they joined.

Changing Schemas
----------------

The (``name``, ``big_name``, ``semester``) headers consist of the
"basic" schema. There are a few other schemas available. They are:

+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Schema  | Headers                                                          |
+=========+==================================================================+
| basic   | name, big\_name, semester                                        |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| keyed   | id, name, big\_id, semester                                      |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| chapter | child, parent, founded                                           |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------+
| sigmanu | badge, first\_name, preferred\_name, last\_name, big\_badge,     |
|         | status, semester, affiliations                                   |
+---------+------------------------------------------------------------------+

Changing schemas can be done with the ``--schema`` option. For example, this
will print the DOT source code of a family tree of chapters to the terminal:

.. code:: bash

    snutree --schema chapter chapters.csv

A custom Python module may be used as a schema:

.. code:: bash

    snutree --schema /home/example/custom.py input.csv

Custom schema modules should validate the tables themselves and turn them into
an internal format ``snutree`` can read.

SQL Queries
-----------

Input files can also be SQL queries. This will run the query in ``query.sql``
on the database described in ``config.yaml`` and save the resulting tree to
``output.pdf``:

.. code:: bash

    snutree --config config.yaml -o output.pdf query.sql

For a SQL query, a `YAML <http://www.yaml.org/start.html>`_ configuration file
with appropriate authentication options must be provided. Here is an example of
the contents of such a file:

.. code:: yaml

    readers:
      sql:
        host: '127.0.0.1'
        port: 3306
        user: 'root'
        passwd: 'secret'
        db: 'database_name'
        # Credentials for tunneling queries through SSH
        ssh:
          host: 'example.com'
          port: 22
          user: 'example'
          private_key: '/home/example/.ssh/id_rsa'

Note that the query must rename the column headers to match the schema used.

Command Line Summary
--------------------

.. code::

{CLI_HELP}

GUI
---

There is also a simple GUI script called ``snutree-gui``. It is a simple
wrapper over the command-line version and implements most of the command-line
features.

Note on Text Encoding
---------------------

All of ``snutree``'s built-in readers and writers use UTF-8, and all of
``snutree``'s configuration files should be encoded in UTF-8. Use ``iconv`` or
similar tools to convert to and from UTF-8 as needed.

Installation
============

With PIP
--------

These instructions are based on Ubuntu and Debian-based installations, but they
can be made to apply to any Unix-like system (including macOS) with what should
be minor modifications. (These instructions are also applicable to Windows,
though after less minor modifications.)

First, install Python (>=3.5), Python's ``pip`` package manager, and `Graphviz
<http://graphviz.org>`_:

.. code:: bash

    # apt install python3 python3-pip graphviz

At this point, ``python3``, ``pip3``, and ``dot`` should be in your PATH:

.. code:: bash

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.X.X
    $ pip3 --version
    pip X.X.X from /path/to/python3/packages (python 3.5)
    $ dot -V
    dot - graphviz version X.XX.X (20XXXXXX.XXXX)

Now install ``snutree`` with:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip3 install --user snutree

This will install ``snutree`` and its required Python dependencies to your home
directory. Make sure that ``~/.local/bin`` is in your PATH. You might run
``pip`` without the ``--user`` flag to install it system-wide, but this will
require root.

Windows
-------

Since installation on Windows is less straightforward, Windows executables have
been compiled and are available `here
<https://github.com/lucas-flowers/snutree/releases>`_. After downloading the
executable, you must install Graphviz and add ``C:\Program Files
(x86)\GraphvizX.XX\bin`` (or equivalent) to your Windows PATH. You can now run
the command-line or GUI executables.

Optional Dependencies
---------------------

Use ``pip`` to install these packages for optional features:

- ``gooey``: Use the GUI version

- ``mysqlclient``: Allow reading from MySQL databases

- ``sshtunnel``: Allow tunneling SQL queries through ssh

- ``pydotplus``: Allow reading data from DOT files (experimental)

Configuration
=============

All configuration is done in YAML (or JSON) files. In the terminal, these files
can be included with ``--config`` flags. Configuration files listed later
override those that came earlier and command line options override all
configuration files.

Below are all of the available options along with descriptions in the comments
and default values where applicable.

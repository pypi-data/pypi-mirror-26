        Returns the primary identifier used application-wide to uniquely identify
        the owning account/Subject.

        The value is usually always a uniquely identifying attribute specific to
        the data source that retrieved the account data.  Some examples:

         - a UUID
         - a long integer value such as a surrogate primary key in a relational database
         - an LDAP UUID or static DN
         - a String username unique across all user accounts

        Multi-Realm Applications
        -------------------------
         In a single-Realm application, typically there is only ever one unique
         principal to retain and that is the value returned from this method.
         However, in a multi-Realm application, where the IdentifierCollection
         might retain identifiers across more than one realm, the value returned
         from this method should be the single identifier that uniquely identifies
         the subject for the entire application.

         That value is of course application specific, but most applications will
         typically choose one of the primary identifiers from one of the Realms.
         Yosai's default implementations of this interface make this assumption
         by usually simply returning the next iterated upon identifier
         obtained from the first consulted/configured Realm during the
         authentication attempt.  This means in a multi-Realm application, Realm
         configuraiton order matters if you want to retain this default heuristic.

         If this heuristic is not sufficient, most Shiro end-users will need to
         implement a custom AuthenticationStrategy.  An AuthenticationStrategy
         has exact control over the IdentifierCollection returned at the end of
         an authentication attempt via the AuthenticationStrategy
         implementation.

class SubjectContext(object):
    """
    A SubjectContext is a 'bucket' of data presented to a SecurityManager
    that interprets data used to construct Subject instances.  It is essentially
    a Map of data with a few additional methods for easy retrieval of objects
    commonly used to construct Subject instances.

    The map can contain anything additional that might be needed by the
    SecurityManager or SubjectFactory implementation to construct Subject
    instances.

    Data Resolution
    ----------------
    The SubjectContext interface allows for heuristic resolution of data
    used to construct a subject instance.  That is, if an attribute has not been
    explicitly assigned, the *resolve methods use heuristics to obtain data
    using methods other than direct attribute access.

    For example, if one references the identifiers property and no identifiers
    are returned, perhaps the identifiers exist in a session or another
    attribute in the context.  The resolve_identifiers method will know
    how to resolve the identifiers based on heuristics.  If the *resolve methods
    return None, then the data could not be achieved through heuristics and must
    be considered unavailable in the context.

    The general idea is that the normal direct attribute access can be called to
    determine whether the value was explicitly set.  The *resolve methods are
    used when actually constructing a Subject instance to ensure the most
    specific/accurate data is used.

    USAGE
    --------------
    Most Yosai end-users will never use a SubjectContext instance directly and
    instead will use a SubjectBuilder (which internally uses a SubjectContext)
    to build Subject instances.

class Subject(object):
    """
    A Subject represents state and security operations for a *single*
    application user.  These operations include authentication (login/logout),
    authorization (access control), and session access. A subject is Yosai's
    primary mechanism for single-user security functionality.

    Acquiring a Subject
    ----------------------
    To acquire the currently-executing Subject, application developers will
    almost always use Yosai:

        Yosai.get_subject()

    Almost all security operations should be performed with the Subject returned
    from this method.

    Permission methods
    --------------------
    Note that there are many Permission methods in this interface that
    accept a list of either String arguments or authz_abcs.Permission instances.
    The underlying Authorization subsystem implementations will usually simply
    convert these String values to Permission instances and then call the
    corresponding method.  (Yosai's default implementations do String-to-Permission
    conversion.

    remembered attribute:
    ---------------------
    Returns True if this Subject has an identity (it is not anonymous) and
    the identity (aka identifiers}) is remembered from a successful
    authentication during a previous session.

    Although the underlying implementation determines exactly how this
    method functions, most implementations have this method act as the
    logical equivalent to this code:

        - subject.identifiers is not None and subject.authenticated

    Note as indicated by the above code example, if a Subject is remembered,
    it is *NOT* considered authenticated.  A check against authenticated
    is a more strict check than that reflected by this method.  For example,
    a check to see whether a subject can access financial information should
    almost always depend on subject.authenticated rather, than this method,
    to *guarantee* a verified identity.

    Once the subject is authenticated, it is no longer considered only
    remembered because its identity would have been verified during the
    current session.

    Remembered vs Authenticated
    -----------------------------
    Authentication is the process of *proving* a subject is who it claims to
    be.  When a user is only remembered, the remembered identity gives the
    system an idea who that user probably is, but in reality, the system
    has no way of absolutely *guaranteeing* whether the remembered Subject
    represents the user currently using the application.

    So, although many parts of the application can still perform user-specific
    logic based on the remembered identifiers, such as customized views,
    the application should never perform highly-sensitive operations until
    the user has legitimately verified its identity by executing a successful
     authentication attempt.

    We see this paradigm all over the web, and we will use
    <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon.com</a> as an example:

    When you visit Amazon.com and perform a login and ask it to 'remember me',
     Amazon will set a cookie with your identity.  If you don't log out and
    your session expires, but you come back the next day, Amazon still knows
    who you *probably* are and so you see all of your book and movie
    recommendations and similar user-specific features since these are based
    on your (remembered) user id (identifiers).

    However, if you try to do something sensitive, such as access your
    account's billing data, Amazon forces you to perform an actual log-in,
    requiring your username and password.

    Amazon does this because although it assumes your identity from
    'remember me', it recognized that you were not actually authenticated.
    The only way to really guarantee you are who you say you are, and
    therefore allow you access to sensitive account data, is to require you
    to perform an actual successful authentication.  You can check this
    guarantee via the subject.authenticated method and not via this method.

        Returns this Subject's application-wide uniquely identifying principal,
        or None if this Subject is anonymous because it doesn't yet have any
        associated account data (for example, if they haven't logged in).

        The term 'principal' is just a fancy security term for any identifying
        attribute(s) of an application user, such as a username, or user id, or
        public key, or anything else you might use in your application to
        identify a user.  Yosai replaces the term 'principal' with 'identifier'

        Uniqueness
        -----------

        considered identifiers as well, Yosai expects the object returned from

        application.

        This implies that attributes like given names and family names are usually
        poor candidates as return values since they are rarely guaranteed to be
        unique.  Items often used for this value:

            - A long-int RDBMS surrogate primary key
            - An application-unique username
            - A UUID
            - An LDAP Unique ID
            - any other similar, suitable, and unique mechanism valuable to your

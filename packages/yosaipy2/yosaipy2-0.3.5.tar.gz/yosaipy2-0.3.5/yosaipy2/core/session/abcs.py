    """
    A Session is a stateful data context associated with a single
    Subject's (user, daemon process, etc) interaction with a software system
    over a period of time.

    A Session is intended to be managed by the business tier and accessible via
    other tiers without being tied to any given client technology.  This is a
    great benefit to Python systems as most viable session mechanisms are
    those highly-coupled and deeply embedded in web application
    frameworks.

    The following attributes are required of a Session:
        session_id: The unique identifier assigned by the system upon session creation.
        start_timestamp: The time that the session started (the time that the system created
                         the instance
        last_access_time: Returns the last time the application received a request or method
                          invocation from THE USER associated with this session.  Application
                          calls to this method do not affect this access time.

        absolute_timeout: Returns the time, in milliseconds, that the session may
                          exist before it expires
        idle_timeout:  Returns the time, in milliseconds, that the session may
                       remain idle before it expires

        host: Returns the host name or IP string of the host that originated this
              session, or None if the host is unknown.

    Evaluates whether Yosai may use a Subject's Session to persist that

    It is a common Yosai implementation strategy to use a Subject's session to
    persist the Subject's identity and authentication state (e.g. after login)
    so that information does not need to be passed around for any further
    requests/invocations.  This effectively allows a session id to be used for
    any request or invocation as the only 'pointer' that Shiro needs, and from
    that, Shiro can re-create the Subject instance based on the referenced
    Session.

    However, in purely stateless applications, such as some REST applications
    or those where every request is authenticated, it is usually not needed or
    desirable to use Sessions to store this state (since it is in fact
    re-created on every request).  In these applications, sessions would never
    be used.

    This interface allows implementations to determine exactly when a Session
    might be used or not to store Subject state on a *per-Subject* basis.

    If you simply wish to enable or disable session usage at a global level for
    all Subject(s), the SessionStorageEvaluator should be sufficient.
    Per-subject behavior should be performed in custom implementations of this

        Performs session validation for all open/active sessions in the system
        (those that have not been stopped or expired), and validates each one.
        If a session is found to be invalid (e.g. it has expired), it is
        updated and saved to the EIS.

        This method is necessary in order to handle orphaned sessions and is
        expected to be run at a regular interval, such as once an hour, once a
        day or once a week, etc.  The &quot;best&quot; frequency to run this
        method is entirely dependent upon the application and would be based on
        factors such as performance, average number of active users, hours of
        least activity, and other things.

        Most enterprise applications use a request/response programming model.
        This is obvious in the case of web applications due to the HTTP
        protocol, but it is equally true of remote client applications making
        remote method invocations.  The server essentially sits idle and only
        *works* when responding to client requests and/or method invocations.
        This type of model is particularly efficent since it means the security
        system only has to validate a session during those cases.  Such
        *lazy* behavior enables the system to lie stateless and/or idle and
        only incur overhead for session validation when necessary.

        However, if a client forgets to log-out, or in the event of a server
        failure, it is possible for sessions to be orphaned since no further
        requests would utilize that session.  Because of these
        lower-probability cases, it might be required to regularly clean-up the
        sessions maintained by the system, especially if sessions are backed by
        a persistent data store.

        Even in applications that aren't primarily based on a request/response
        model, such as those that use enterprise asynchronous messaging (where
        data is pushed to a client without first receiving a client request),
        it is almost always acceptable to utilize this lazy approach and run
        this method at defined interval.

        Systems that want to proactively validate individual sessions may
        simply call the get_session(session_key) method on any
        ValidatingSessionManager instance as that method is expected to
        validate the session before retrieving it.  Note that even with
        proactive calls to get_session, this validate_sessions
        method should be invoked regularly anyway to *guarantee* no
        orphans exist.

        Note:
        Yosai supports automatic execution of this method at a regular interval
        by using SessionValidationScheduler(s).  The Yosai default
        SecurityManager implementations needing session validation will
        create and use one by default if one is not provided by the

    def get_active_sessions(self):
        """
        Returns all sessions in the EIS that are considered active, meaning all
        sessions that haven't been stopped/expired.  This is primarily used to
        validate potential orphans.

        If there are no active sessions in the EIS, this method may return an
        empty collection or None.

        Performance
        -----------
        This method should be as efficient as possible, especially in larger
        systems where there might be thousands of active sessions.  Large
        scale/high performance implementations will often return a subset of
        the total active sessions and perform validation a little more
        frequently, rather than return a massive set and validate infrequently.
        If efficient and possible, it would make sense to return the oldest
        unstopped sessions available, ordered by last_access_time.

        Smart Results
        -------------
        *Ideally*, this method would only return active sessions that the EIS
        was certain should be invalided.  Typically that is any session that is
        not stopped and where its last_access_timestamp is older than either
        session timeout (idle or absolute).

        For example, if sessions were backed by a relational database or SQL-92
        'query-able' enterprise cache, you might return something similar to
        the results returned by this query (assuming SimpleSession(s) were
        being stored):

            SELECT *
            FROM sessions s
            WHERE s.lastAccessTimestamp < {idle_timeout} and
                  s.lastAccessTimestamp < {absolute_timeout} and
                  s.stopTimestamp is null

        :returns: a Collection of session(s) that are considered active, or an
                  empty collection or None if there are no active sessions
        """
        pass

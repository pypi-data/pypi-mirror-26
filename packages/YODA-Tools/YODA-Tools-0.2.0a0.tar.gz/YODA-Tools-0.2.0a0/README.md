This repository contains tools for validating and managing
[YODA files](https://github.com/ODM2/YODA-File).
YODA is short for "YAML Observations Data Archive" and is a file-based implementation of Version 2 of the CUAHSI Observations Data Model (ODM2).
YODA files are encoded using YAML.

YODA files can be generated by exporting data from a set of Microsoft Excel data templates or by exporting data directly from an operational instance of ODM2.

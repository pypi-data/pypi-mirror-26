ParseIt
=======

A simple parsing tool in 200 lines of python

Give it a grammar and tokens, and itâ€™ll give you back an ast.

Inputs
------

Use the ``parse()`` function to parse text. The ``tokens`` parameter is
a dictionary of token names to compiled regular expressions. Prefixing a
token with ``%`` will ignore it. Token names must be uppercase.

The ``rules`` parameter is a dictionary of names to lists of rules, and
the ``start`` parameter is what node to start parsing first. ``postlex``
and ``postparse`` and post-processing functions. The default will:

-  after lexing remove all tokens that start with a ``%``
-  after parsing flatten all nodes with 1 child

Rules
~~~~~

A rule is a list of rulesegments. A rulesegment can be a string, which
means parse that TOKEN/rule_name. A list rule segement is a group, the
last item in it can be one of the following:

-  ``?``: this group is optional
-  ``+``: match at least one of this group, and possibly more
-  ``*``: match any number of this group, including zero

An example rule looks like this:

.. code:: python

    [["NUM", "?"], ["var", "*"]]

The rule dictionary is a dictionary of rule_names to lists of these
rules, each one being a possibility, like this:

.. code:: python

    {
        "multi_poly": [
            ["LPAREN", "polynomial", "RPAREN", "LPAREN", "polynomial", "RPAREN"],
            ["NUM", "LPAREN", "polynomial", "RPAREN"],
            ["polynomial"]
        ]
    }

Output
------

The tree format of ParseIt is very simple: for rule instances (nodes)
you have a tuple with the first value being the node name, and the
second being its children.

Tokens are represented as a tuple of: the token name, the token content,
and its position in the stream

``treeify``
-----------

There is also a module called treeify in the package that (if pydot is
installed) allows you to create a graphical representation of the
generated trees.

Example
-------

``example.py`` has an example grammar and code to convert the generated
tree into a pydot

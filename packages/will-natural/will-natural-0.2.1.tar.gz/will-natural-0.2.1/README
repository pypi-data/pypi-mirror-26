This is a *temporary* fork of the [official natural](https://github.com/tehmaze/natural) repo to add Python 3 support, and allow pip to keep working with the behavior changes with the --process-dependency-links deprecation.

Once [the python 3 pull request](https://github.com/tehmaze/natural/pull/13) is merged and a new version is released, this package will be deleted.

Description: 
        This is a *temporary* fork of the `official natural <https://github.com/tehmaze/natural>` repo to add Python 3 support, and allow pip to keep working with the behavior changes with the --process-dependency-links deprecation.
        
        Once `the python 3 pull request <https://github.com/tehmaze/natural/pull/13>` is merged and a new version is released, this package will be deleted.

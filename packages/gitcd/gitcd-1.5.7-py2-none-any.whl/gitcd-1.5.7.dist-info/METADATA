Continuous tool for working with git
====================================

.. image:: https://travis-ci.org/claudio-walser/gitcd.svg?branch=master
    :target: https://travis-ci.org/claudio-walser/gitcd

Description
-----------

**gitcd** is a little helper for continuous integration workflows using
git as scm.

Installation
------------

Since gitcd is using python3 by default, you better upgrade.

After successful installation of python3 and pip for pyhton3, run the following command to install and upgrade gitcd:

.. code:: console

    pip3 install gitcd --upgrade

Argument Completion
-------------------

Gitcd supports argument completion, to activate this feature in linux run:

.. code:: console

    sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete3

Under OSX it isn't that simple unfortunately. Global completion requires bash support for complete -D, which was introduced in bash 4.2. On OS X or older Linux systems, you will need to update bash to use this feature. Check the version of the running copy of bash with echo $BASH_VERSION. On OS X, install bash via Homebrew (brew install bash), add /usr/local/bin/bash to /etc/shells, and run chsh to change your shell.
Afterwards you might be able to also just run:

.. code:: console

    sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete3

Usage
-----

Afterwards you have to cd into one of your local directories
representing a git repository and run the init command

.. code:: console

    git cd init

After passing all your configuration data, start working with it

**Pull request status** You are able to see the status of a feature
branch including the pull request and if it has been already reviewed by
someone.

.. code:: console

    git cd status

**Clean up local branches**\ \* The tool is able to cleanup all local
branches which doesent exist on the origins. This is done with:

.. code:: console

    git cd clean

It only deletes local branches and doesent touch remote ones. If one of
the branches to delete is your current checked-out branch, the tool
checkout the master branch locally in order to delete the feature
branch.

**Start new feature**

Starts a new feature branch from your master branch

.. code:: console

    git cd start <branchname>

**Test a feature branch**

Merges a feature branch into your development branch

.. code:: console

    git cd test <branchname>

**Open a pull request for code review**

Opens a pull request to your master branch - not working yet

.. code:: console

    git cd review <branchname>

**Finish a feature branch**

Merges it into your master and asks for permission to delete your
feature branch

.. code:: console

    git cd finish <branchname>

**Compare your current branch**

Compares your current branch against the given branchname or the latest
tag if none is given

.. code:: console

    git cd compare <branchname>

**Tagging the master branch**

Creates a tag from your master branch and pushes it to remote

.. code:: console

    git cd release

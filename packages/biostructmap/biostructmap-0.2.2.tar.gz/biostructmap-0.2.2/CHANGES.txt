v0.2.2, 2017-10-24 -- Remove Scipy dependency and refactor calls to DSSP
 * Removed SciPy dependency, which simplifies install process.
 * DSSP is only called if it is required, for example when there is a need to calculate secondary structure or solvent accessibility.
 * Also removed redundant methods for writing output data to file.
 * Updated README to reflect optional requirements for BLAST+, Exonerate and DSSP.

v0.2.1post1, 2017-10-24 -- Include CHANGES.txt in distributed files (oops!)

v0.2.1, 2017-10-24 -- Minor changes to documentation and distribution

v0.2.0, 2017-10-24 -- Major update, first release since making biostructmap public.
 * Added features:
   * Additional genetic tests (Watterson's theta, nucleotide diversity)
   * Added multi-chain support. This allows mapping of data from different chains.
   * Some code refactoring was performed. map method is now available from the Structure class, not each individual Chain.
 * Data requirements altered slightly. Each data object should be associated with a particular set of structure chains e.g. {('A', 'B'): data_1, ('C',): data_2}
 * Reference sequences should be provided for each chain: {'A': seq_1, 'B': seq_1, 'C': seq_2}

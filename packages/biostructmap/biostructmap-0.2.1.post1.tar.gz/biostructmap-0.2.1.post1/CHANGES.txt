v0.2.1, 2017-10-24 -- Minor changes to documentation and distribution

v0.2.0, 2017-10-24 -- Major update, first release since making biostructmap public.
 * Added features:
   * Additional genetic tests (Watterson's theta, nucleotide diversity)
   * Added multi-chain support. This allows mapping of data from different chains.
   * Some code refactoring was performed. map method is now available from the Structure class, not each individual Chain.
 * Data requirements altered slightly. Each data object should be associated with a particular set of structure chains e.g. {('A', 'B'): data_1, ('C',): data_2}
 * Reference sequences should be provided for each chain: {'A': seq_1, 'B': seq_1, 'C': seq_2}

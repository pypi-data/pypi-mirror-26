Contributing
============

We welcome contributions of any sort - bug reports, enhancements, pull
requests etc.

Please use the GitHub `issues
tracker <https://github.com/andrewguy/biostructmap/issues>`__ to flag
potential bugs or improvements.

Pull requests
-------------

Feel free to make a pull request with any suggested
changes/bugfixes/improvements, although it would be best to flag any
major work in an issue tracker before making a pull request.

A pull request will generally **not** be accepted if it does not include
the appropriate unit tests. If this is an issue (i.e. if you're unsure
how to write a unit test), feel free to discuss in an issue tracker - we
can probably work something out. All tests should pass before you submit
a pull request.

All Python code should follow `PEP8
guidelines <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/>`__. If any
existing code breaks PEP8 guidelines (without good reason), we beg
forgiveness, and would welcome any pull requests to rectify this.

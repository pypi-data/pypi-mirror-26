        ------------
        A very simple scaffold for constructing python packages
        
        
        Installation
        ============
        * run ``pip install python-git-package``
        
        
        Introduction
        ============
        This package can be used for scaffolding new packages.
        The command ``pgp init`` creates a new package in the current folder.
        The command ``pgp release`` creates a new release.
        The command ``pgp doc`` builds the docs using sphinx.
        
        The package layout is as follows:
        
        .. code:: bash
            
            mypackage
             |-- .git
             |-- doc
             |    |--source
             |        |-- _static
             |        |-- _templates
             |        |-- conf.py
             |        |-- index.rst
             |        |-- mypackage.rst
             |
             |-- examples
             |-- mypackage
             |    |-- __init__.py
             |    |-- __version__.py
             |    |-- mypackage.py
             |
             |-- tests
             |    |-- all.py
             |    |-- test_mypackage.py
             |
             |-- .gitignore
             |-- LICENSE
             |-- MANIFEST.in
             |-- README.rst
             |-- setup.py
        
        All files are populated with basic content so the notorious task of manually creating ``setup.py```or ``manifest.in`` is taken out of the users task.
        
        Furthermore, the init command initializes a git repository with two branches, ``master`` and ``dev`` in the package folder.
        The ``master`` branch is intended for published releases only.
        It should allwats point to the latest release.
        The ``dev`` branch is used for develloping the package.
        To ease the process of creating a new release

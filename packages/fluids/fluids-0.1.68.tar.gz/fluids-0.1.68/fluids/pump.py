def VFD_efficiency(P, load=1):
    r'''Returns the efficiency of a Variable Frequency Drive according to [1]_.
    These values are generic, and not standardized as minimum values.
    Older VFDs often have much worse performance.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P : float
        Power, [W]
    load : float, optional
        Fraction of motor's rated electrical capacity being used

    Returns
    -------
    efficiency : float
        VFD efficiency, [-]

    Notes
    -----
    The use of a VFD does change the characteristics of a pump curve's
    efficiency, but this has yet to be quantified. The effect is small.
    This value should be multiplied by the product of the pump and motor
    efficiency to determine the overall efficiency.

    Efficiency table is in units of hp, so a conversion is performed internally.
    If load not specified, assumed 1 - where maximum efficiency occurs.
    Table extends down to 3 hp and up to 400 hp; values outside these limits
    are rounded to the nearest known value. Values between standardized sizes
    are interpolated linearly. Load values extend down to 0.016.
    
    The table used is for Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) VFDs.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> VFD_efficiency(10*hp)
    0.96
    >>> VFD_efficiency(100*hp, load=0.2)

    r'''Returns the efficiency of a NEMA motor according to [1]_.
    These values are standards, but are only for full-load operation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P : float
        Power, [W]
    closed : bool, optional
        Whether or not the motor is enclosed
    poles : int, optional

    efficiency : float
        Guaranteed full-load motor efficiency, [-]

    Notes
    -----
    Criteria for being required to meet the high-efficiency standard is:

    * Designed for continuous operation
    * Operates by three-phase induction
    * Is a squirrel-cage or cage design
    * Is NEMA type A, B, or C with T or U frame; or IEC design N or H
    * Is designed for single-speed operation
    * Has a nominal voltage of less than 600 V AC
    * Has a nominal frequency of 60 Hz or 50/60 Hz
    * Has 2, 4, or 6 pole construction
    * Is either open or closed

    Pretty much every motor is required to meet the low-standard efficiency
    table, however.

    Several low-efficiency standard high power values were added to allow for
    easy programming; values are the last listed efficiency in the table.

    Examples

    0.93
    >>> CSA_motor_efficiency(100*hp, closed=True, poles=6, high_efficiency=True)

def motor_efficiency_underloaded(P, load=0.5):
    r'''Returns the efficiency of a motor operating under its design power
    according to [1]_.These values are generic; manufacturers usually list 4
    points on their product information, but full-scale data is hard to find
    and not regulated.

    Parameters
    ----------
    P : float
        Power, [W]
    load : float, optional
        Fraction of motor's rated electrical capacity being used

    Returns
    -------
    efficiency : float
        Motor efficiency, [-]

    Notes
    -----
    If the efficiency returned by this function is unattractive, use a VFD.
    The curves used here are polynomial fits to [1]_'s graph, and curves were
    available for the following motor power ranges:
    0-1 hp, 1.5-5 hp, 10 hp, 15-25 hp, 30-60 hp, 75-100 hp
    If above the upper limit of one range, the next value is returned.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> motor_efficiency_underloaded(1*hp)
    0.8705179600980149
    >>> motor_efficiency_underloaded(10.1*hp,  .1)

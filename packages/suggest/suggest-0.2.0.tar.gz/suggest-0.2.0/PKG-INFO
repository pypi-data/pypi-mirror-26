Description: suggest imports
        ===============
        `suggest` should be called in a project folder, . Currently only Rust (Cargo)
        projects are supported. This is an early version of something that will
        hopefully increase awareness of available packages in Python, NodeJS, Rust, Go
        and other languages.

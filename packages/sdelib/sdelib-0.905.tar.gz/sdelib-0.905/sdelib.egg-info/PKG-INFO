Description: sdelib is a Python package (written in Python 3.5) for performing various
        actions on Ito stochastic differential equations (SDE). These actions include:
        1) Input SDEs as SDEprob objects.
        2) Solve SDEs with an SDEint class that performs numerical Ito integration on
        SDEprob objects.
        3) Estimate strong and weak orders of convergence through a SDEanalysis class
        4) Perform these actions either through creating a Python script which uses the
        above classes, or running gui.py which allows you to perform these actions
        quickly through a GUI.
        
        sdelib was written as part of a Master's thesis and is intended to be able to
        do simple actions on SDEs without requiring a lot of coding to do so.
        
        
        This version requires Python 3 or later;

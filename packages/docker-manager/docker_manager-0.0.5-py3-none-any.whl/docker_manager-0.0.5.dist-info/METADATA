Command line tool for managing docker-containers
================================================

Description
-----------
docker-manager is a tool similar to docker-compose but it handles a few additional things like
nginx config for proxying/clustering webservices and handling basic auth. And it's also adding hosts entries for each container.

Installation
------------

Since docker-manager is using python3 by default, you better upgrade.

After successful installation of python3 and pip for pyhton3, run the following command to install or upgrade docker-manager:

.. code:: console

    pip3 install --user --upgrade docker-manager

If you are on mac osx and your local python folder isn't in your PATH variable you might add it to $PATH or symlink it in /usr/local/bin with sudo.

**Max OSX**

.. code:: console

    sudo ln -s /home/<username>/.local/bin/docker-container /usr/local/bin/
    sudo ln -s /home/<username>/.local/bin/docker-image /usr/local/bin/
    sudo ln -s /home/<username>/.local/bin/docker-watcher /usr/local/bin/
    sudo ln -s /home/<username>/.local/bin/docker-bridge /usr/local/bin/

The same applies to linux, however, the path is different. (On usual Distributions this is in $PATH already)

.. code:: console

    sudo ln -s /home/<username>/.local/bin/docker-container /usr/local/bin/
    sudo ln -s /home/<username>/.local/bin/docker-image /usr/local/bin/
    sudo ln -s /home/<username>/.local/bin/docker-watcher /usr/local/bin/
    sudo ln -s /home/<username>/.local/bin/docker-bridge /usr/local/bin/

Argument Completion
-------------------

docker-manager supports argument completion, to activate this feature in linux run:

.. code:: console

    sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete3

Under OSX it isn't that simple unfortunately. Global completion requires bash support for complete -D, which was introduced in bash 4.2. On OS X or older Linux systems, you will need to update bash to use this feature. Check the version of the running copy of bash with echo $BASH_VERSION. On OS X, install bash via Homebrew (brew install bash), add /usr/local/bin/bash to /etc/shells, and run chsh to change your shell.
Afterwards you might be able to also just run:

.. code:: console

    sudo activate-global-python-argcomplete3

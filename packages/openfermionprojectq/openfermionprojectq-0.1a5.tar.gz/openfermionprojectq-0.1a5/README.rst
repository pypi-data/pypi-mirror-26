`OpenFermion <http://openfermion.org>`_ is an open source package for compiling and analyzing quantum algorithms that simulate fermionic systems.
This plugin library allows the circuit simulation and compilation package `ProjectQ <https://projectq.ch>`_ to interface with OpenFermion.

Getting started
===============

Installing OpenFermion-ProjectQ requires pip. Make sure that you are using an up-to-date version of it.
Once installation is complete, be sure to take a look at the
`ipython notebook demo <https://github.com/quantumlib/OpenFermion-ProjectQ/blob/master/examples/openfermionprojectq_demo.ipynb>`__
as well as our detailed `code documentation <http://openfermion-projectq.readthedocs.io/en/latest/openfermionprojectq.html>`__.

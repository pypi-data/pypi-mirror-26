        Pyro is a flexible, scalable deep probabilistic programming library
        built on PyTorch. Notably, it was designed with these principles in
        mind: - **Universal**: Pyro is a universal PPL â€“ it can represent any
        computable probability distribution. - **Scalable**: Pyro scales to
        large data sets with little overhead compared to hand-written code. -
        **Minimal**: Pyro is agile and maintainable. It is implemented with a
        small core of powerful, composable abstractions. - **Flexible**: Pyro
        aims for automation when you want it, control when you need it. This is
        accomplished through high-level abstractions to express generative and
        inference models, while allowing experts easy-access to customize
        inference.
        
        Pyro is in an alpha release. It is developed and used by `Uber AI
        Labs <http://uber.ai>`__. More information is available in the `launch
        blog post <http://eng.uber.com/pyro>`__.

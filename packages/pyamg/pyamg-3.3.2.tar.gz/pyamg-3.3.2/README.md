# What is AMG?

 AMG is a multilevel technique for solving large-scale linear systems with optimal or near-optimal efficiency.  Unlike geometric multigrid, AMG requires little or no geometric information about the underlying problem and develops a sequence of coarser grids directly from the input matrix.  This feature is especially important for problems discretized on unstructured meshes and irregular grids.

# PyAMG Features

PyAMG features implementations of:

- **Ruge-Stuben (RS)** or *Classical AMG*
- AMG based on **Smoothed Aggregation (SA)**

and experimental support for:

- **Adaptive Smoothed Aggregation (Î±SA)**
- **Compatible Relaxation (CR)**

The predominant portion of PyAMG is written in Python with a smaller amount of supporting C++ code for performance critical operations.

# Example Usage

PyAMG is easy to use!  The following code constructs a two-dimensional Poisson problem and solves the resulting linear system with Classical AMG.

````python
import pyamg
import numpy as np
A = pyamg.gallery.poisson((500,500), format='csr')  # 2D Poisson problem on 500x500 grid
ml = pyamg.ruge_stuben_solver(A)                    # construct the multigrid hierarchy
print(ml)                                           # print hierarchy information
b = np.random.rand(A.shape[0])                      # pick a random right hand side
x = ml.solve(b, tol=1e-10)                          # solve Ax=b to a tolerance of 1e-8
print("residual: ", np.linalg.norm(b-A*x))          # compute norm of residual vector
````

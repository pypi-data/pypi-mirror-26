PyAMG: Algebraic Multigrid Solvers in Python

PyAMG is a library of Algebraic Multigrid (AMG)
solvers with a convenient Python interface.

PyAMG features implementations of:

- Ruge-Stuben (RS) or Classical AMG
- AMG based on Smoothed Aggregation (SA)
- Adaptive Smoothed Aggregation (Î±SA)
- Compatible Relaxation (CR)
- Krylov methods such as CG, GMRES, FGMRES, BiCGStab, MINRES, etc

PyAMG is primarily written in Python with
supporting C++ code for performance critical operations.

        ArchGenXML - UML to code generator for Plone
        ============================================
        
        .. contents::
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        With *ArchGenXML* you can create working python code without writing one single 
        line of python. It is is a commandline utility that generates fully functional 
        Zope_ Products based on the Archetypes_ framework from UML_ models using XMI 
        (``.xmi``, ``.zargo``, ``.zuml``) files. The most common use case is to generate 
        a set of custom content types, possibly with a few tools, a custom Member type 
        and some workflows thrown in.
        
        .. _Zope: http://zope.org
        .. _Archetypes: http://plone.org/documentation/manual/archetypes-developer-manual
        .. _UML: http://www.uml.org/
        
        How it works
        ============
        
        In practice, you draw your UML diagrams in a tool like ArgoUML_  which has the 
        ability to generate XMI files. Once you are ready to test your 
        product, you run *ArchGenXML* on the XMI file, which will generate the product 
        directory. After generation, you will be able to install your product in Plone 
        and have your new content types, tools and workflows available.
        
        .. _ArgoUML: http://argouml.tigris.org
        
        At present, round-trip support is not implemented: Custom code can't be 
        converted back into XMI (and thus diagrams). However, you can re-generate 
        your product over existing code. Method bodies and certain *protected* code 
        sections will be preserved. This means that you can evolve your product's 
        public interfaces, its methods and its attributes in the UML model, without 
        fear of losing your hand-written code.
        
        Supported Plone Versions
        ========================
        
        We support Plone Versions 2.5.x and >3.1.x. But if you have code generated 
        with some ArchGenXML version below 2 you will need to adjust the generated 
        model and code manually. There is no smooth migration. If you dont need to make 
        your code run on Plone 3, stick to an older version of ArchGenXML.
        
        Further Reading
        ===============
        
        The Manual_ documents most of ArchGenXML features. There are also plenty third 
        party documentations in several languages. Just use Google_ to find more on 
        this topic.

        Changelog
        =========
        
        2.7 (2017-11-08)
        ----------------
        - Added possibility to use tagged value 'icon' on actions to manage the icon_expr.
          [gbastien]
        
        - Added Tagged value 'icon' available for workflow transition.
          [gbastien]
        
        - Added a disable_increment_profile_vernum tagged value.
          If it is True, version number in metadata.xml is not upgraded at each generation.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Add icons metadata files.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Use png as default icons.
          If folder_icon or document_icon is set as content_icon, do not copy it.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Allow multiple worlkflows.
          If many workflows are embedded with class, each workflow is binded in workflows.xml.
          'use_workflow' attribute adds a workflow to embedded workflows.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Abstract class have no workflow binding.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Import Column classes with DataGridField.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Added a protected section in workflows definition.xml.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - View action is always ${object_url}/view, otherwise select layout doesn't
          work anymore.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - When we add content_icon with null value on a class, icon expr is empty.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Add Site Administrator to ignored extra roles if plone >= 4.1.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Default plone target version is 4.1.
          It's easier to change default version.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Fixed configure.zcml core section protection.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Now, manage formats of generic setup version number as n, n1.n2,
          and not only n1.n2.n3.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - If plone_target_version tagged-value is set to 4.0 or 4.1, then generate
          icon_expr instead of content_icon for FTIs.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Add a protected FOOT section in type.xml.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Add vocabulary_factory tagged value.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Avoid deprecated import warning under Zope 2.13+.
          [thomasdesvenain]
        
        - Fixed inconstancy between template name and portlet class by removing .pt in the generation
          [jihaisse]
        
        - Added method generation for portlet class.
          The portlet class will look like the classic portlet.
          [jihaisse]
        
        
        2.6 (2011-03-10)
        ----------------
        
        - make z3 interfaces the default interface and dont accept any longer zope2
          interfaces
          [jensens]
        
        - Use portal_type tagged-value if available instead of class name when
          generating workflows.xml.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - remove unneccessary imports for remember/membrane,
          view permissions can now additionally be specified in the dependency
          association to the content class,
          name of the view template can now additionally be specified in the
          dependency relation between view class and content class,
          pass fixed size parameter to arrayfield (i.e. 4 generates size-4) ,
          browser views: name on dpendency determines name of view,
          remove old generator i18n support.
          [zworkb]
        
        - tgv for dynatree widget
          [hpeteragitator]
        
        - Added worklist:guard_expressions tag definition.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Fixed UnicodeEncodeError when writing the code of existing methods
          back to the files and the code is in the unicode format.
          [deo]
        
        
        2.5 (2010-09-04)
        ----------------
        
        - Extender doesn't generate interfaces twice anymore.
          [jensens]
        
        - You can now set meta_type="Subtractive Workflow" (default is "Workflow")
          and state_var="confidential_state" for example (default is "review_state")
          on a workflow to use it with collective.subtractiveworkflow.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Added roles and permissions protected sections in rolemap.xml.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Replaced buggy odict implementation by the ordereddict implementation
          available in Python 2.7.
          [moldy]
        
        - Unicode fixes for generated module info header.
          [moldy]
        
        - Removed DeprecationWarning about the sets module.
          [vincentfretin]
        
        - Header info: use better formatting for author.
          Encode module header strings so we don't choke on non-ASCII chars.
          [moldy]
        
        - Make "dependend_profiles" alternative as multi-tgv available
          (avoid ultra-long tgvs).
          [jensens]
        
        - Added virtual field type "keywords" which results in a LinesField with
          KeywordWidget (this needs a tgv catalog:index=1).
          [jensens]
        
        - Prevent error on empty tgv.
          [hpeteragitator]

A straightforward command line tool for generate seccomp json profile

Overview
========
Seccomp (short for secure computing mode) is a computer security 
facility in the Linux kernel.
Seccomp allows a process to make a one-way transition into a "secure"
state where it cannot make any system calls except exit(),
sigreturn(), read() and write() to already-open file descriptors.
Should it attempt any other system calls, the kernel will terminate
the process with SIGKILL or SIGSYS.
In this sense, it does not virtualize the system's resources but isolates 
the process from them entirely.

Generated seccomp profile can be use with a lot of applications like:

- docker
- firefox
- systemd
- openssh
- chrome
- and more...

Install
=======
.. code:: shell

    $ git clone https://github.com/gr0und-s3ct0r/cerber
    $ cd cerber
    $ pip install pbr
    $ python setup.py install # cerber is now installed in your environment

Usage
=====
.. code:: shell

    $ cerber docker run hello-world # a seccomp_profil.json was created in the current directory
    $ ls
    seccomp_profil.json
    $ cat seccomp_profil.json
    {
        "defaultAction": "SCMP_ACT_ERRNO", 
        "architecture": [
            "SCMP_ARCH_X86_64", 
            "SCMP_ARCH_X86", 
            "SCMP_ARCH_X32"
        ], 
        "syscalls": [
            {
                "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW", 
                "args": [], 
                "name": "read"
            }, 
            ...
            {
                "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW", 
                "args": [], 
                "name": "execve"
            }, 
            {
                "action": "SCMP_ACT_ALLOW", 
                "args": [], 
                "name": "arch_prctl"
            }
        ]
    }

and now you can assign this security profil to your container at run:

.. code:: shell

    $ docker run \
    --rm \
    --security-opt="no-new-privileges" \
    --security-opt seccomp=seccomp_profile.json \
    hello-world # you can get the following output for docker hello world

    Hello from Docker!
    This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

    To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
    1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.

        ======
        
        Moneta is a web application emulating different kinds of package repositories.
        The goal is not to replace official mirrors like packages.debian.org or mirror.centos.org,
        but to have a single location for all your Python/Java/Debian/RedHat private packages.
        
        Repositories are created on-the-fly and you can limit upload rights to some groups of users.
        
        Currently, you can create the following types of repositories:
        
          * Aptitude for Ubuntu or Debian systems,
          * Yum for CentOS, Fedora or Red Hat systems,
          * Maven for Java or Scala packages,
          * Pypi for Python packages,
          * Gem for Ruby packages,
          * Jetbrains for IntelliJ/PyCharm/PhpStorm/RubyMine/AppCode/CLion plugins,
          * Vagrant boxes,
          * any binary, versionned files.
        
        A more complete [documentation](http://moneta.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html) is available.
        
        Some following kinds of repositories will be added in the future:
        
          * Docker containers,
          * Dash & Zeal docsets,
          * Shinken packages,
          * packages for vim,
          * nuget for Windows packages,
          * brew (packaging system for OS X),
          * CPAN for Perl,
          * LaTeX,
          * PHP,
          * JS.

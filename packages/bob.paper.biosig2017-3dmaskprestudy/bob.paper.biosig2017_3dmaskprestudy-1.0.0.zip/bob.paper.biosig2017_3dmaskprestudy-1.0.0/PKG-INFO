        If you use this package and/or its results, please cite the paper.
        
        Installation
        ------------
        The installation instructions are based on conda_ and works on **Linux systems only**. 
        `Install conda`_ before continuing.
        
        Once you have installed conda_, download the source code of this paper and
        unpack it.  Then, you can create a conda environment with the following
        command::
        
            $ cd bob.paper.biosig2017_3dmaskprestudy
            $ conda env create -f environment.yml
            $ source activate bob.paper.biosig2017_3dmaskprestudy  # activate the environment
            $ buildout
        
        This will install all the required software to reproduce this paper.
        
        
        Downloading the dataset
        -----------------------
        This package works with the ERPA_ dataset published by IDIAP. Please download the dataset before proceeding.
        
        
        Generating the plot
        -------------------
        Figure 5 in the paper shows distributions of the mean pixel-values of the face-region in the thermal images captured using the Xenics Gobi camera.
        To reproduce this plot, use the following command:
        
        .. code-block:: sh
        
            $ ./bin/thermal_mean_hist.py -ip <input-ERPA-folder>/Xenics_Gobi/ -op <output-plot-folder>
        
        
        where <input-ERPA-folder> should be the folder containing the ERPA_ dataset, and <output-plot-folder> should specify the folder where you want the plot to be created as a pdf file.
        This command will process images from the 'Xenics_Gobi' sub-folder in the specified input-folder (<input-ERPA-folder>), and create a file called **thermal_profile_hist.pdf** in the specified output folder.

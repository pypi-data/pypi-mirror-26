 What is ClassicMenu Indicator?
================================

ClassicMenu Indicator is a notification area applet (application
indicator) for the top panel of Ubuntu’s Unity desktop environment and
other environments that support the AppIndicator protocol.

It provides a simple way to get a GNOME Classic-style application menu
for those who prefer this over the Unity dash menu.

If you use WINE applications or games they are available in
ClassicMenu Indicator, too. Depending on your local settings you may
have to open the Preferences dialog from the ClassicMenu Indicator
submenu and activate the WINE menu there.

Pinax
------

Pinax is an open-source platform built on the Django Web Framework. It is an ecosystem of reusable Django apps, themes, and starter project templates.
This collection can be found at http://pinaxproject.com.

This app was developed as part of the Pinax ecosystem but is just a Django app and can be used independently of other Pinax apps.


pinax-points
-------------

``pinax-points`` is a points, positions and levels app for Django.

``pinax-points``, formerly agon, provides the ability to track points on arbitrary
objects in your system.  The common case being ``User`` instances. It can
additionally keep track of positions for these objects to produce leaderboards.

This code has mostly been pulled out of `typewar`_ and made slightly more
generic to work well.

Description: LoggerServer
        ============
        
        An async TCP logging server base on tornado.ioloop, which serve for logging.handlers.SocketHandler.
        
        Introduce
        ---------
        
        To solve `Python separate processes logging to same file <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15096090/python-separate-processes-logging-to-same-file/47323076>`_.
        
        Official description::
        
            Although logging is thread-safe, and logging to a single file from multiple threads in a single process is supported,
            logging to a single file from multiple processes is not supported, because there is no standard way to serialize access
            to a single file across multiple processes in Python. If you need to log to a single file from multiple processes, one
            way of doing this is to have all the processes log to a SocketHandler, and have a separate process which implements a
            socket server which reads from the socket and logs to file.
        
        Reference: `logging cookbook <https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging-cookbook.html#logging-to-a-single-file-from-multiple-processes>`_
        
        
        ``LoggerServer`` use ``tornado`` build a high-performance TCP logging server to slove this problem.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/qd-cae/qd-cae-python.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/qd-cae/qd-cae-python)
[![Join the chat at https://gitter.im/sahat/hackathon-starter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/qd-cae-python/Lobby?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link)

This Python3 library is an open source software package with utility functions regarding engineering, especially Simulation and Computer Aided Engineering (CAE).
The library is still young, so features drop in over time depending on the needs of the persons who contribute. Visit our website at http://www.qd-eng.de/

CAE suffers greatly from expensive tools with bad or moderate scripting access and utility. Also many algorithms developed in research never get published due to licensing or being very specific regarding a certain software environment. Engineering is lacking behind here in contrast to modern informatics.

We want to tackle this issue with this free library, in order to give engineering a boost. Simple data access is crucial for further ideas to emerge! Use this library, build more awesome applications with it, share your projects too if not critical and please contribute to us or science in general.

# What's new?

*Changelog 9.10.2017*
Version 0.6.5

qd.cae.dyna
  - `RawD3plot` is a new class to give access to the raw data of a d3plot (see [here](https://qd-cae.github.io/qd-cae-python/build/html/qd_cae_dyna_RawD3plot.html)). Read the docs carefully and don't use this class without a specific purpose! The access to the data array is given in a dict-like manner.


*Changelog 26.09.2017*
Version 0.6.4

qd.cae.dyna
 - `Keyfile` has now two new options: `load_includes` and `encryption_detection`. The first one can be used to prevent loading of includes and the secondary one is used for detection of encrypted include files (see [here](https://qd-cae.github.io/qd-cae-python/build/html/qd_cae_dyna_KeyFile.html#qd.cae.dyna.KeyFile)).
- Added function: `get_file_entropy` (see [here](https://qd-cae.github.io/qd-cae-python/build/html/qd_cae_dyna_functions.html#qd.cae.dyna.get_file_entropy)), which is a helper function for the argument `encryption_detection` in the `KeyFile` constructor.

  - Read Input Files (partially done)
2. [qd.numerics](https://qd-cae.github.io/qd-cae-python/build/html/qd_numerics.html)
  - Submodule: sampling
3. [qd.cae.beta](https://qd-cae.github.io/qd-cae-python/build/html/qd_cae_beta.html)
  - MetaCommunicator (control META remotely)

# Installation

## Windows

For **Windows** (x64 Python 3.5 and higher) install by using pip. The precompiled wheels are always compiled with FEMZIP support, allowing you to read compressed files directly. Since the package is uploaded to pipy, the following should work:

```
pip install qd
```

or

```
python -m pip install qd
```

The wheels, which are used by pip, can also be found here in the [dist folder](https://github.com/qd-cae/qd-cae-python/tree/master/dist). If neccessary download the appropriate one and install it with:

```python
pip install [path/to/downloaded/wheel]
```

Note though that your windows python distribution might not neccessarily find an appropriate version and fail. In that case one has three options:

 - Download and use [Anaconda Python x64](https://www.continuum.io/downloads#windows)
 - Compile it yourself (see the [compilation guide](https://qd-cae.github.io/qd-cae-python/build/html/compilation_guide.html))  
 - Open a request for compilation of a specific distribution

## Linux

In the [dist folder](https://github.com/qd-cae/qd-cae-python/tree/master/dist) usually are some precompiled Linux wheels for installation with pip. Note that Linux wheels rarely work accross different systems, so do not expect them to work and in case of trouble see the [compilation guide](https://qd-cae.github.io/qd-cae-python/build/html/compilation_guide.html). It's quite simple to compile it yourself on Linux (‚ù§).

# Compilation

If you are bold enough to compile it yourself, then follow the [compilation guide](https://qd-cae.github.io/qd-cae-python/build/html/compilation_guide.html).

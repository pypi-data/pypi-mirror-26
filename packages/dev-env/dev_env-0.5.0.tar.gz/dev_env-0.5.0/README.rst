This repo was originally created as a way to centralize the
code/configuration used to provision development environments. As time
went on it became clear that it would be helpful to centralize other
common development tools and utilities. This repo now contains tools,
scripts and utilities which:

-  provision development environments
-  automate cutting releases
-  simplify integration testing

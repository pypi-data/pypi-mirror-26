About
=====

This is a `pytest plugin
<http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/plugins.html>`_ that enables next
generation sequencing `pytest fixtures
<http://doc.pytest.org/en/latest/fixture.html>`_, including fastq
files and output files from a variety of bioinformatics applications
and tools. There are sequencing fixtures for some common sample
layouts, but it's easy to generate additional sample fixture layouts
using fixture factories.

See the `pytest-ngsfixtures documentation`_ for more information.

Welcome to gmpy2 project!
-------------------------

gmpy2 provides fast multiple-precision arithmetic to Python. gmpy2 is an
optimized C extension that supports the GMP, MPFR, and MPC libraries.

gmpy2 is based on the original gmpy module. gmpy2 adds support for correctly
rounded multiple-precison real (using the MPFR library) and complex (using
the MPC library) arthmetic.

The gmpy2 2.0.x series is a stable version that is only receiving bug fixes.
The main development branch (2.1.x) was extensively refactored. The most
significant changes are support for thread-safe contexts and context methods.

gmpy2 2.0.x is available at https://pypi.python.org/pypi/gmpy2.

To install a development version of gmpy2 2.1.x, just clone or copy
the repository and follow the instructions in the INSTALL file. Detailed
instructions for building on Windows using the MSYS2/MINGW-W64 tool chain
can be found in msys2_build.txt

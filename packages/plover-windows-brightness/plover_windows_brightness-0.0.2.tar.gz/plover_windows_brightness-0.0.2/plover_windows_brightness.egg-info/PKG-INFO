Description: Plover Windows Brightness Control
        =================================
        
        Add support for controlling Windows monitor brightness from Plover.
        
        Sample Usage
        ------------
        
        Monitor brightness is a value between 0 and 100. You have three
        available commands to manipulate this brightness: BRIGHTNESS_SET, BRIGHTNESS_UP, and BRIGHTNESS_DOWN.
        
        Increase Brightness
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  ``{PLOVER:BRIGHTNESS_UP}``
        
           Increase brightness by 10 points.
        -  ``{PLOVER:BRIGHTNESS_UP:20}``
        
           Increase brightness, specifying 20 points.
        
        Decrease Brightness
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  ``{PLOVER:BRIGHTNESS_DOWN}``
        
           Decrease brightness by 10 points.
        -  ``{PLOVER:BRIGHTNESS_DOWN:20}``
        
           Decrease brightness, specifying 20 points.
        
        Setting Brightness
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
        
        -  ``{PLOVER:BRIGHTNESS_SET:50}``
        
           Set brightness to half.

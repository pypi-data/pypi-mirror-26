============
Introduction
============

This library provides a pure Python interface for the `HERE API <https://developer.here.com/>`_. It works with Python versions from 2.7+ and Python 3.

`HERE <https://www.here.com/>`_ provides location based services. HERE exposes a `rest APIs <https://developer.here.com/documentation>`_ and this library is intended to make it even easier for Python programmers to use.

================
Getting the code
================

The code is hosted at https://github.com/abdullahselek/HerePy

Check out the latest development version anonymously with::

    $ git clone git://github.com/abdullahselek/HerePy.git
    $ cd HerePy

To install dependencies, run either::

    $ pip install -Ur requirements.testing.txt
    $ pip install -Ur requirements.txt

To install the minimal dependencies for production use (i.e., what is installed
with ``pip install python-twitter``) run::

    $ pip install -Ur requirements.txt

=============
Running Tests
=============

The test suite can be run against a single Python version which requires ```pip install pytest``` and optionally ```pip install pytest-cov``` (these are included if you have installed dependencies from ```requirements.testing.txt```)

To run the unit tests with a single Python version::

    $ pytest

to also run code coverage::

    $ py.test --cov=herepy

To run the unit tests against a set of Python versions::

    $ tox

------
Models
------

The library utilizes models to represent various data structures returned by HERE:
    * herepy.GeocoderResponse
    * herepy.RoutingResponse

-----------
GeocoderApi
-----------

Is the wrapper for HERE Geoder API, to use this wrapper and all other wrappers you need a AppId and AppCode which you
can get from `HERE Developer Portal <https://developer.here.com/>`_.

Initiation of GeocoderApi

.. code::

    import herepy

    geocoderApi = herepy.GeocoderApi('app_id', 'app_code')

Geocoding given search text

.. code::

    response = geocoderApi.FreeForm('200 S Mathilda Sunnyvale CA')

Geocoding given search text with in given boundingbox

.. code::

    response = geocoderApi.AddressWithBoundingBox('200 S Mathilda Sunnyvale CA',
                                                  [42.3952,-71.1056],
                                                  [42.3312,-71.0228])

Geocoding with given address details

.. code::

    response = geocoderApi.AddressWithDetails(34, 'Barbaros', 'Istanbul', 'Turkey')

Geocoding with given street and city

.. code::

    response = geocoderApi.StreetIntersection('Barbaros', 'Istanbul')

----------
RoutingApi
----------

Initiation of GeocoderApi

.. code::

    import herepy

    routingApi = herepy.RoutingApi('app_id', 'app_code')

Calculate route for car

.. code::

    response = routingApi.CarRoute([11.0, 12.0],
                                   [22.0, 23.0],
                                   [herepy.RouteMode.car, herepy.RouteMode.fastest])

Calculate route for pedestrians

.. code::

    response = routingApi.PedastrianRoute([11.0, 12.0],
                                          [22.0, 23.0],
                                          [herepy.RouteMode.pedestrian, herepy.RouteMode.fastest])

Calculate route between three points

.. code::

    response = routingApi.IntermediateRoute([11.0, 12.0],
                                            [15.0, 16.0],
                                            [22.0, 23.0],
                                            [herepy.RouteMode.car, herepy.RouteMode.fastest])
Route for public transport

.. code::

    response = routingApi.PublicTransport([11.0, 12.0],
                                          [15.0, 16.0],
                                          [herepy.RouteMode.publicTransport, herepy.RouteMode.fastest],
                                          True)

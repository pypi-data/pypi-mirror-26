# Juantap 

## Get started

1. Install juantap with `pip3 install git+https://github.com/mathiassmichno/juantap`
2. Configure juantap as wanted: `juantap config -e`
3. Create the file `~/gslts.txt` with the Game Server Login tokens in.
   * One token per line per game server, so each instance have a token
4. Setup juantap root and install LGSM: `juantap root setup --install` (it can take some time)
   * LGSM requires the following dependencies:
       * tmux
       * wget
       * ca-certificates
       * file
       * bsdmainutils
       * util-linux
       * python
       * bzip2
       * gzip
       * unzip
       * binutils
       * lib32gcc1
       * libstdc++6:i386
   * Do not run it in tmux, LGSM run its scripts in tmux, and can't handle nested tmux
   * If it will not install, try to run `~/rootserver/csgoserver install` to install LGSM manually
      * Th√≠s will also tell which dependencies are missing, and offer to install them automatically
   * `juantap root setup --install` returns, without any errors, if any dependencies are missing
      * It is first when you try to run `juantap instances cmd start`, that it tells the dependencies are missing
5. Run `~/rootserver/csgoserver mods-install` and install the following mods:
   * metamod
   * sourcemod
   * steamworks
   * smjansson
   * get5 
6. Copy common settings to the root server: `juantap root config -c`
7. Scaffold instances: `juantap instances scaffold`
8. Mount the instances: `juantap instances mount`
9. Copy the settings to the instances: `juantap instances setup`	
10. Start the CS servers: `juantap instances cmd start`

## Usage
* To control all instances: `juantap instances cmd xx`
   * For instance:  `juantap instances cmd stop`
* To control a single instance: `juantap instances -i yy cmd xx`
   * For instance: `juantap instances -i 01 cmd details`

juantap can be used with a system which incorporate Challonge.
This system can be found [here](http://csgo.michno.me).
To use this system with juantap, juantap have to be running on a server with a public accessible IP.
And have the following plugins installed (all should be installed on the root server, using the `mod-install` or `mi` command listed above):
 - MetaMod (`metamod`)
 - Sourcemod (`sourcemod`)
 - get5 (`get5`), and get5_apistats, which will be in the `disabled` folder after installing get5
 - SteamWorks (`steamworks`)

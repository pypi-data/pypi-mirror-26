    :title: Unable to install the module on OS X

    The module is tested on Windows and on Linux
    through `travis <https://travis-ci.org/sdpython/pyensae>`_.
    It is not tested on OS X (Apple), the installation was failing
    on a student's machine today (however he installed almost
    all the version including 3.5a).

    If that is the case, I recommend to install *pyensae* and
    *pyquickhelper* without their dependencies::

        pip install <module> --no-deps

Am I cognitively fit to use ``inxs``?
-------------------------------------

If you're comfortable with Python and ``lxml``, you propably are. Just give it a try to solve a
smaller problem. If you don't get a grip on something that may be due to the immature
documentation.

If you aren't, you should be willing to get acquainted with both. In this case it is recommended
to test your understanding and assumptions without ``inxs`` as well. bpython_ and Jupyter_ are
great playgrounds.

Can I get help?
---------------

In case you carefully studied the documentation, just open an issue on the `issue tracker`_.
Mind that you can't get supported to solve your actual problem, but rather to understand and use
``inxs`` as a tool to do so.

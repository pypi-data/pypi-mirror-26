        Keyring OTP
        ===========
        
        Keyring OTP is a CLI to generate One Time Password from secrets stored in
        `Gnome Keyring <https://wiki.gnome.org/action/show/Projects/GnomeKeyring>`_
        (the `seahorse's <https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Seahorse>`_ backend).

        ------------
        Installation
        ------------
        
        This application is properly running on debian stretch in python3 virtual
        environement::
        
            $ python3 -m venv koptvenv
            $ source ./kotpvenv/bin/activate
        
        This requiere ``xclip`` on your computer to temporary put the secret in
        your clipboard at the end of the program the initial value is back in your
        clipboard::
        
            $ apt install xclip
        
        .. note::
        
            If you are using ``-o`` option (console output) the app won't complaints
            if xclip is not there.
        
        Install using your favorite installer. For example::
        
            $ pip install keyring-otp
        
        -----
        Usage
        -----
        
        use ``-h`` to get recent help::
        
            $ kotp -h
            usage: kotp [-h] [-s SECRET] [-o] [-d DURATION] keyring key
        
            CLI to generate One Time Password from secrets stored in Keyring (using
            seahorse password manager)
        
            positional arguments:
              keyring
              key
        
            optional arguments:
              -h, --help            show this help message and exit
              -s SECRET, --secret SECRET
                                    Force using secret from command line instead getting
                                    it from the password manager. (as keyring and key are
                                    mandatory set any values they will be ignored).
              -o, --output          Display output in console and in the clipboard (useful
                                    if you can't install xclip).
              -d DURATION, --duration DURATION
                                    How many seconds you wants the One Time Password in
                                    your clipboard. Note that as time is changing, the
                                    TOTP password will be updated and your clipboard will
                                    be updated too!
        
        Let's assume I've a keyring called ``otp`` which contains a key called github
        wich contains my github otp password.
        
        .. figure:: seahorse.png
            :alt: Seahorse Gnome password manager
        
        To get the Time based OTP password in my clipboad I do::
        
            $ kotp otp github
        
        .. note::
        
            At the time writting the ``otp`` keyring must be unlock before running
            the application.
        
        Here an other example by giving the OTP password value in command line::
        
            $ kotp -s SECRETS -o -d 35 nothing real
            Current TOTP 887562 at Wed Nov  8 07:48:18 2017
            Current TOTP 291833 at Wed Nov  8 07:48:30 2017
        
        
        .. warning::
        
            This option is discouraged as long your OTP secret will be in your bash
            history, we may remove this option to replace it with a prompt in the
            future

        Roadmap
        -------
        
        * Setup CI
        * First release
        * make it usable as an API, API consumer may add multiple callback they should
          be called once OTP as benn changed (callback may be declared in entry point
          to let user define new callback easly), this apps should declare some
          default behaviours likes:
            - print in console
            - filling clipboard (require an init method and final method to set back
              current clipboad value)
        * Prompt to unlock keyring
        * Thinking replace ``-s`` option to let user use
        * use python keyring to make this app portable with more password manager:
          GnomeKeyring (for Gnome environments) or KDEWallet (for KDE environments)
          or Win32CryptoRegistry (for Windows)
        * manage passman backends
        * save new secrets

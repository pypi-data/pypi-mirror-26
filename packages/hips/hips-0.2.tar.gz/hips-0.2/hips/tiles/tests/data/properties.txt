obs_description      = Color composition generated by CDS. This HiPS survey is based on 2 others HiPS surveys, respectively DSS2-red and DSS2-blue HiPS, both of them directly generated from original scanned plates downloaded from STScI site. The red component has been built from POSS-II F, AAO-SES,SR and SERC-ER plates. The blue component has been build from POSS-II J and SERC-J,EJ. The green component is based on the mean of other components. Three missing plates from red survey (253, 260, 359) has been replaced by pixels from the DSSColor STScI jpeg survey. The 11 missing blue plates (mainly in galactic plane) have not been replaced (only red component).

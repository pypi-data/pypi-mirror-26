        ======
        
        arclib aims at providing a unified API for accessing Python's archive formats. In
        particular, it provides the following APIs:
        
        - Basic, one-shot: For gzip, bzip2, and LZMA. Supports one-shot compression and
          decompression.
        - Basic, incremental: For bzip2 and LZMA. Supports incremental compression and
          decompression.
        - Complex: For zip and tar. Supports accessing the various members and their
          respective information.

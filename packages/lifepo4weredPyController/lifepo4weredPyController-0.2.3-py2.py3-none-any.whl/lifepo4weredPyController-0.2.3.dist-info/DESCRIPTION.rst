Our intention is to design an oriented object access to the
lifepo4wered-pi3 data module during runtime application.

Using the Raspbery Pi zero in many projects, I found this product
very usefull. So to help my children and python colleagues, we design this.

You can find here the documentation of the lifepo4wered product:

Description: coda_kids
        =========
        
        coda_kids is a partial wrapper package around pygame. It's purpose is to
        make game development more accessible to a younger audiences
        of students. It provides inline documentation, wrappers for linter 
        unfriendly features, and provides utility functionality/classes such 
        as game objects and constants for common data such as colors and input.
        
        It is currently being designed for and tested with a series of
        game programming exercises for an educational textbook titled Coda Kids.
        
        The package is being designed and implemented with and for the
        following toolset:
        
        Python 3.5.2 with latest Pygame and Pylint.
        Latest Visual Studio Code (1.11+ as of writting) with the Python extension installed.
        
        Simple Example
        --------------
        ::
        
            import coda_kids as coda
        
            WINDOW = coda.Vector2(800, 600)
            SCREEN = coda.start(WINDOW, "Hello World!")
            TEXT = coda.TextObject(coda.color.BLACK, 48, "Hello World!")
            TEXT.location = WINDOW / 2 # center of window
            TEXT.centered = True
        
            while True:
                for event in coda.event.listing():
                    if coda.event.quit_game(event):
                        coda.stop()
                coda.start_draw(SCREEN, coda.color.WHITE)
                TEXT.draw(SCREEN)
                coda.end_draw()
        
        
        To Do
        =====
        
        1) Add a 2D animation class supportable by objects.
        2) Runtime type checking for coda_kids class constructors and function arguments.
        3) Provide additional example code and documentation.
        4) Clean up object interface methods.
        5) Refactor finite state machine tools.

"""This module contains a simple wrapper for pygame's event system.

coda kid's assignments rely on pylint to help catch potential errors, 
but some of the constants in pygame give false positives.

This event wrapper is meant to quiet some of those false positives,
while providing a function interface for keyboard and mouse input.

Description: SciPy Stack download helper
        ===========================
        
        This package simply has the packages that are part of the SciPy stack as dependencies, defined
        here: https://www.scipy.org/stackspec.html . It is unofficial and contains no code. Run 'pip install 
        scipy-stack' to install all official scipy-stack packages, if your system is able to compile them. Note that 
        this will install the non-MKL version of numpy.
        
        Now that Scipy v1.0.0 is available, this package should install properly on both Windows and Linux.
